considering the low reliability factor of the sea kings , all four may not have been available that particular night . 
how would the government explain to the people of the world that kind of embarrassment ? 
senator boudreau : 
honourable senators , as senator forrestall i am sure will agree , i do not wish to speculate on what the operational requirements were on that particular evening , indeed , whether there was any normal availability of that fourth aircraft , and , if not , why that might have been the case . 
i can simply say that i have continually sought reassurances that the equipment and the personnel we send to these often very dangerous missions do a remarkable job , and demonstrate competence and dedication to the task at hand . 
i am further assured that the equipment they serve on is capable of fulfilling the mission safely . 
senator forrestall : 
honourable senators , the minister has missed the point of my question . 
we had four sea kings on that task force . 
was one of them embarked on that task force solely for the purpose of being scavenged for spare parts for the other three ? 
does the minister not believe that when we send vessels to sea they should be equipped to carry out the missions for which they are tasked , otherwise we should not send them ? 
does the minister not agree with that common - sense approach ? 
when the leader of the government is questioning the minister of national defence , would he put that simple proposition to the minister ? 
why in hell would we send four sea kings to sea if they did not work ? 
senator boudreau : 
honourable senators , my honourable friend is questioning which aircraft were deployed and for what purpose . 
they are all very important operational questions . 
i will convey the honourable senator ' s inquiry to the minister of national defence . 
i can only assume at this stage that there were very clear operational requirements for the equipment as it was deployed , but i will ask the questions and attempt to bring back a more specific answer to the honourable senator as soon as possible . 
human resources development 
job creation programs - possible mismanagement of funds - request for inquiry 
hon. w . david angus : 
honourable senators , when i rose here last thursday , i thought it would be the last time i would be talking about this hrdc matter and all that arises therefrom . 
i thought we could get into a more healthy situation , given my interest and the government ' s interest in revitalizing and restructuring our health care system . 
this morning , the front page of the ottawa citizen , that well - known journal , indicated : 
the dilution of responsibility in the human resources development canada job grants fiasco underscores the need for a full - scale inquiry into the operations of government , say experts in public administration . 
" it will be a textbook case that touches on the most important issues of public administration : the role of elected officials , the role of parliament and accountability . 
you can ' t get much more basic than that , " said donald savoie , a political scientist at the universit é de moncton . 
in my questioning of the honourable leader of the government in the senate in late february , i did ask on several occasions - and i think he will recall that i did - whether the government is prepared to call an inquiry . 
hon. j . bernard boudreau ( leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , i thank the honourable senator angus for raising this topic once again . 
given his recent comments , i would have been disappointed if that had not been the case . 
i anticipated that the honourable senator might raise this topic again , in spite of the comments of the last day , and had occasion to obtain a copy of the testimony of the auditor general and read it prior to today ' s sitting . 
i did not bring it with me , but i can recall some of the points that i wish to share with honourable senators in relation to that testimony . 
mr. desautels gave the audit that was done great credibility . 
he said it was a credible and competent audit . 
i think senator angus was calling for an independent audit because he was concerned that the internal audit perhaps was not as thorough , as good or as competent as it should have been . 
when i read the comments of the auditor general , i thought that senator angus would now be satisfied and reassured that the original audit was thoroughly and competently done . 
honourable senators , the next thing the auditor general said in his testimony was that he had examined the multi - faceted program put in place by the minister to deal with the issues raised by the audit . 
the auditor general said he was satisfied with the credible steps taken by the minister . 
the auditor general thought that was a legitimate , competent approach to the evidence raised in the audit . 
therefore , he was pleased with the hrdc response . 
the third matter that comes to mind from the testimony of mr. desautels , which may be of interest to honourable senators is when he was asked if he had any views on why some of these problems may have arisen . 
the auditor general said , and i am paraphrasing now because i do not have the material before me , that there may have been an overemphasis on the customer service aspect of these programs . 
in other words , the department was perhaps going too far to service the clientele who , by the way , are canadians . 
that is something to be concerned about , but if there is a fault that is forgivable or at least understandable here , it would be that fault . 
of all of the things he might have said when asked the question , " how do you think some of these deficiencies occurred , " that was the answer that most pleased me . 
senator angus : 
honourable senators , i thank the minister for that comprehensive answer . 
i am pleased to note that we are getting his attention , that he is anticipating that he will have to deal with this horrendous situation and is doing his research . 
what the auditor general said about the interim audit carried out in hrdc was that this audit dealt only with record - keeping . 
he said he will now conduct an audit into hrdc and the very effectiveness of the six - point action plan ordered by the hrdc minister , the honourable jane stewart , to clean up the mess . 
the auditor general described the problem as persistent , serious and ranking at the very top of his concerns . 
he said he would look into the possibility of money being spent in ways that would not achieve its intended purpose . 
the auditor general even said that this terrible situation was the most disturbing one that he had encountered in his nine years in that function . 
will the government please call a full inquiry into this matter so we can clean it up and give canadians a sense of confidence in their administration again ? 
senator boudreau : 
honourable senators , the auditor general referred to two types of audits in his testimony . 
it is important to distinguish between them , as the honourable senator did to some extent . 
one of them is an accounting audit which checks to ensure that the money was properly paid out ; that payments conformed with the program ; and that when payment was made , a receipt was issued . 
checks were made to ensure that the entire audit trail was in place and properly carried out . 
that is the type of audit that was done internally . 
we know the results , and we know that the minister has acted , according to the auditor general , in an appropriate way . 
above and beyond the accounting audit is what i used to refer to as a " value - for - money " audit , which involves an examination of the programs to see if they are achieving the goals to which the policy had directed the programs . 
auditors general , historically , have pushed the envelope in this direction to determine , from a value - for - money approach , whether programs are doing the types of things they are meant to do . 
that is an entirely different type of audit and over the past 20 years , auditors general in every government in this country have been pushing harder into that area . 
this auditor general is no different . 
he wants to push harder into that area , too . 
there is a line somewhere - and i am not quite sure where it is drawn - over which an auditor general moves from accounting policy into public policy . 
that has been a moving goalpost for a number of years . 
the honourable senator asked if we would support an inquiry . 
the auditor general outlined what he felt was appropriate in his testimony . 
he will pursue the matter and , in fact , we will have more and more of these value - for - money audits . 
senator angus : 
senator boudreau : 
honourable senators , i have no indication at this time that the government will do such a thing . 
agriculture and agri - food 
effect of high fuel costs on farm community 
hon. leonard j . gustafson : 
honourable senators , my question to the minister and the government is about the increased fuel prices that have been of great concern to all canadians in every area but more particularly in agriculture . 
everything that is done in agriculture creates an energy cost . 
according to the keystone agricultural producers who appeared before the senate committee , a 3,000 - acre farm in manitoba that had fuel costs of approximately $ 33,750 last year , will have costs of $ 47,250 this year . 
even if a farmer receives the whole amount of the recently announced canada - manitoba adjustment payment , or cmap , it will cover only 80 per cent of that increase in the cost of fuel . 
the farmers have no way to pass on this cost or absorb that kind of expense . 
has the government looked at these fuel costs in regard to farmers ? 
this is a very serious problem for farmers . 
would the minister look into the matter and carry that message to cabinet ? 
hon. j . bernard boudreau ( leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , of course i will carry such a message to cabinet . 
the government has shown a level of concern in this area , even though regulation of gas prices , as the honourable senator knows , falls within the jurisdiction of the provincial governments . 
the recently announced conference board of canada study will give us an opportunity to look at the entire picture . 
in any kind of action , we want to be sure we understand all the factors that have an impact on price . 
any action that might be taken by provincial governments or other parties should be the most effective possible . 
i also offer to honourable senators some news of which you may already be aware . 
opec members have agreed to increase their daily production by almost 1.5 million barrels . 
that in itself is not an answer , but supply is an important factor in pricing . 
by increasing the supply , the hope is that the price will be depressed . 
senator gustafson : 
honourable senators , we are all aware that a barrel of oil has gone from $ 10 to $ 32 . 
that is my point , that oil companies have a way of protecting themselves and doing it very quickly . 
the farmers do not have the same ability to recover their costs . 
farmers in the food chain today are getting such a small amount of the actual food charge that they cannot bear the cost of these increased fuel costs . 
just to make the point , i take a little can of gas and use it to take a load of wheat to the macoun co - op. 
that is a cost of just over $ 5 , which is equivalent to two bushels of wheat . 
the costs are unbelievable . 
i cannot stress enough the importance of these fuel costs because they can wipe out everything the government has done to try to help . 
as positive as those efforts were , these increases in fuel costs can wipe out those efforts . 
would the minister please carry the seriousness of this cost increase in fuel to the cabinet ? 
senator boudreau : 
honourable senators , of course , i will convey , as i have in the past , the honourable senator ' s concerns in this area , particularly with respect to the situation of farmers dealing with increased oil costs . 
the fluctuations in oil prices have been quite dramatic over the past 10 years , resulting in fairly unpredictable cost levels for canadians in all walks of life . 
as the honourable senator points out , this situation has a direct impact on the farmers of this country . 
once we have conducted an independent and thorough study of this question , i hope that we will be able to understand more clearly how we might have an impact on that situation and , perhaps , avoid these wild swings in price . 
senator gustafson : 
the minister will know as well that the government receives a lot of money from taxes that accrue to the federal and provincial governments . 
i sat on the energy committee during the lalonde days , when we were nailed with $ 9 - billion worth of exchange that went to eastern canada . 
it was a pretty serious situation . 
at that time , the percentages were very high . 
an awful lot of the cost of a gallon of fuel goes to both the federal and the provincial governments . 
surely , because of this increased money that comes to the coffers , they could give some serious consideration to this matter . 
senator boudreau : 
honourable senators , in spite of the question of jurisdiction that rests with the provinces , the government of canada has and continues to be concerned . 
it is attempting to act prudently by commissioning an independent and thorough study of the situation . 
we do not want to act precipitously in one direction only to have price swings wildly in the other direction and see the action that we took wiped out overnight . 
orders of the day 
business of the senate 
hon. dan hays ( deputy leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , under government business , i should like to call no. 1 and no. 2 , the supply bills , as indicated on the order paper . 
after we have dealt with those items , i should like to call order no. 4 , bill c - 20 , and then follow the order of business as set out in the order paper . 
appropriation bill no. 4 , 1999 - 2000 
third reading 
honourable senators , there is sufficient and clear consensus on behalf of all of us here that this bill should proceed to third reading . 
i also wish to state again , very clearly for the record , that i took senator kinsella ' s remarks yesterday with some seriousness , and i am sure the government has also . 
i wish to reiterate that i think all honourable senators are well aware that the defeat of a bill such as this would certainly result in either a resignation of a government or a defeat of a government . 
i wanted to make that point . 
with the permission of honourable senators , i should like to make a correction to hansard . 
yesterday ' s record of my speech contains a slight error . 
on page 853 of my speech at second reading on bill c - 29 , the third paragraph reads , " later the same day , the senate adopted that report . " 
that sentence should read , " earlier today , the senate adopted that report . " 
having said that , honourable senators , i think the question should now be put . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed . 
appropriation bill no. 1 , 2000 - 01 
third reading 
honourable senators , once again i shall reiterate that there is clear and unanimous consensus on both sides of the chamber to move this bill along and to give it third reading . 
i wish to restate , for the sake of the record and for the sake of clarity , the very important role that the senate was given in respect of the finances and expenditures of her majesty ' s government . 
having said that , honourable senators , i think we can proceed with some dispatch . 
i am eager and willing to hear what senator lynch - staunton has to say on bill c - 20 , so i shall delay no more . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed . 
bill to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the supreme court of canada in the quebec secession reference 
second reading - debate continued 
on the order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the honourable senator boudreau , p . c . , seconded by the honourable senator hays , for the second reading of bill c - 20 , to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the supreme court of canada in the quebec secession reference . 
hon. john lynch - staunton ( leader of the opposition ) : 
honourable senators , in my wildest imagination , i never thought that there would come a day when the parliament of canada would be asked to approve a bill intended to sanction conditions under which the breakup of this country could ensue . 
even less did i ever see myself as a participant in such a debate . 
i do so with great reluctance , as passage of bill c - 20 will confirm secession as a valid and legal objective . 
i simply do not accept that this option should ever be before parliament , much less sanctioned by it . 
bill c - 20 denies the history of this country - one of continuous and oftentimes painful negotiation between its partners . 
it denies the basic makeup of this country , a voluntary association able to accommodate all but the most extreme demands made on it . 
it abandons the principle of flexibility which allows any region to advance its individuality without compromising that of the others . 
if yes to both , which predominates ? 
one did not have to be even a first - year law student to know the answers , but the minister no doubt felt that by dragging the supreme court into the political arena , it would gladden the hearts of many , particularly those in areas where quebec - bashing is a popular sport . 
had the court , however , limited itself strictly to answering the questions , parliament would not be put in the awkward position it is in presently . 
instead , for reasons known only to itself , the court went way beyond the reference and set out in broad and vague language under what conditions the breakup of the country could be negotiated . 
in a most extraordinary trespassing on the jurisdiction of parliament and every provincial legislature , the supreme court gave legitimacy to separation , and now the government is using the supreme court as justification to confirm secession as a lawful objective . 
it might interest honourable senators to know that in the 1996 study produced for the c . d . howe institute , it was found that of 89 constitutions examined , " 82 do not permit secession of a part of a state ' s territory under any circumstances , " and 22 of this latter group contain explicit prohibitions of secession . 
in addition , one has yet to find a single government that would not reject out of hand the notion that it preside over the breakup of the country . 
the attitude of a federal government - any federal government - to a secession movement may be confidently predicted to be more or less hostile . 
the government may be expected to take the view that it did not assume office to preside over the dissolution of the federation . 
this government has yet to properly explain why it rejects what has seldom been rejected by all its predecessors . 
this bill , like the supreme court opinion it relies on , is provocative and incomplete . 
it does not specify a question or define a majority . 
bill c - 20 , like the court , uses the word " clear " , while staying away from defining it . 
the house of commons alone will decide that , which means the government , which means the prime minister ' s office to which for years the house has casually abandoned much of its authority . 
this alone makes the bill reprehensible and not worthy of support . 
one person surrounded by an unelected coterie of faithful insiders will decide upon the propriety of the question and whether the support it receives can or cannot lead to negotiating the breakup of canada . 
what obviously matters to this government is not the long - term damage this legislation will cause but the short - term political gains it believes it brings . 
bill c - 20 was condemned by the quebec government and its satellite operation in ottawa , while being received enthusiastically in many parts of the country , and revealed open dissension in more than one opposition party . 
these initial results have , no doubt , caused much joy in the langevin block . 
this is no surprise . 
for forty years , few headlines have not referred to quebec ' s grievances , real or imagined , whatever the government in office . 
the slogans are similar and lend themselves to over - interpretation . 
" ma î tres chez nous " , " é galit é ou ind é pendance " and " souverainet é - association " , for example , are the natural heirs of what was once called " autonomie provinciale " . 
the exhaustion and the frustration caused by the uncertainties generated by such crises are felt in quebec as well and not just by its minority language . 
however , we must not forget that the history of quebec , even before 1867 , is marked by efforts aimed at survival and recognition , efforts too often misunderstood and rejected by an often indifferent , if not hostile , majority . 
far be it for me to attempt even a brief history of quebec , from an agricultural society dominated by political and religious elites to an industrial one free of the discipline and fear these elites imposed for far too long . 
no one must forget , however , that whatever the nature of quebec society , there is one constant which changes only in emphasis , not in nature : that of not just keeping a unique identity in north america , but in resisting all threats to it , perceived and real . 
nationalism as we know it in quebec today is not new , only the way it is being expressed . 
most historians trace quebec ' s nationalism origins to 1885 , when the french - speaking catholic louis riel was hanged . 
later , manitoba withdrew its support of denominational schools and then disallowed the use of french in the legislature and in the courts . 
the establishment of alberta and saskatchewan in 1905 included little to guarantee catholic minority rights . 
in 1912 , ontario adopted regulation 17 , severely limiting the instruction of french ; and in 1916 , the privy council ruled that the french language was constitutionally protected only in the courts and in the canadian and quebec parliaments . 
the reaction throughout was a belief that the compromises that led to the approval of the federation and the belief that french canadian rights were the same across the country had been betrayed . 
quebec turned onto itself and promoted the idea that canada resulted from an agreement between two founding peoples , not from an agreement between four colonies . 
only quebec could henceforth protect and further its majority ' s culture , as the rest of the country had abandoned its commitment to it , or so it was widely accepted . 
gone was the spirit that motivated sir wilfrid laurier , who fought so hard for equality of rights when the western provinces were being formed . 
it was replaced by acrimonious debates , such as those over conscription in 1917 , 1942 and 1944 , and the imposition of the 1982 constitution over the will of all sides in quebec ' s national assembly . 
examples of forcing the majority ' s will on the minority abound and are not limited to ottawa . 
the quebec national assembly has passed legislation aimed at promoting majority values at the expense of minority ones . 
honourable senators , bill c - 20 allows the majority to sit in judgment of a minority . 
a country cannot exist in harmony if minorities are meant to feel vulnerable , if not despised . 
the house of commons always thinks in majorities . 
the senate ' s equation has traditionally been based on equality , and it is in this light that bill c - 20 must be studied . 
in his remarks , he said : 
once it is passed , this resolution will have an impact on how legislation is passed in the house of commons . 
i remind canadians that the legislative branch will be bound by this resolution , as will the executive branch . 
the prime minister ended by saying : 
it is easier to attack than to work together . 
it is easier to shout than to listen . 
it is easier to destroy than to build . 
it is easier , yes , but it is wrong for ourselves , for our children and for our country . 
the shouters , the attackers , the destroyers have had their say . 
now canadians want to get on with building canada . 
honourable senators , is bill c - 20 what the prime minister was thinking of when he spoke about impact , working together , listening and building canada ? 
by no stretch of the imagination can his eloquence of less than five years ago be reconciled with the blunt instrument he is asking parliament to place at his disposal . 
bill c - 20 is , in fact , a rejection of the prime responsibility of every national government since confederation - that is , keeping and enhancing the unity of the country . 
the federation has been called a reluctant partnership , and ever since 1867 , the national government has had as its top priority a determination to solidify the partnership , despite the frustrations , disappointments and political setbacks that are too often the only reward for these efforts . 
confederation was effectively a marriage of economic and political convenience between partners who had little desire to live together but could not afford to live apart . 
the reluctance with which the british north american colonies entered into their national partnership foreshadowed the persistence of the regional and cultural discontent that would characterize canada ' s development in the last third of 19 th century and throughout the 20 th century . 
with bill c - 20 , we are being asked to support the government in withdrawing from its responsibility of being the main unifying catalyst and , instead , allow it unilaterally to decide when it is appropriate to formally discuss secession . 
this bill is , in effect , a not - too - subtle sanctioning of the power of disallowance found in the constitution , not used since 1943 and rejected by virtually all constitutional scholars and others as being out of date and no longer worthy of being used . 
not only , however , is bill c - 20 giving the house of commons the right to disallow a vote of a provincial legislature , even a unanimous one , but also it allows a majority popular vote in a referendum to be nullified . 
even the framers of the british north america act never dared to go that far . 
let us look for a moment at the power of disallowance contained in the constitution act , 1867 . 
the late chief justice of the supreme court , bora laskin , termed the disallowance power as " dormant , if not entirely dead . " 
in macgregor dawson ' s the government of canada , the usefulness of this power is described in relation to the charter of rights and freedoms on the basis that " some of the main reasons that might have been adduced to activate the disallowance power before 1982 seem to have been largely dissipated by the charter . " 
again , dean hogg , on the power of disallowance , said : 
its use today would provoke intense resentment on the part of the provinces . 
if the federal objection to a provincial statute is that it is ultra vires or inconsistent with a federal law , the province may fairly insist that a court is the appropriate forum to determine the issue . 
if the federal objection to a provincial statute is that it is unwise , then the province may fairly reply that its voters should be left to determine the wisdom of the policies of the government which they have elected . 
in my view , the provincial case is unimpeachable : the modern development of the ideas of judicial review and democratic responsibility has left no room for the exercise of the federal power of disallowance . 
william estey , in his submission last week to the senate committee studying the nisga ' a treaty , also spoke of what he called " the power of disallowance which was frequently used in the early years of canada to prevent injustice " . 
now it is being introduced to allow injustice . 
whether we believe the federal power of disallowance to be dead or alive , bill c - 20 certainly resurrects it in another form . 
it gives the house of commons the power to basically set aside or disallow a referendum question duly enacted by a provincial legislature and then disallow or ignore a referendum result based on that or another question . 
the issue before us deserves better treatment than that given by the leader of the government in the senate who found sport in ridiculing the leader of the progressive conservative party for using the word " ambiguity " , and , in a feeble effort at humour , saying that " ambiguity is the friend of the parti qu é b é cois . " 
some hon. senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senator lynch - staunton : 
on the other hand , having gone this far , bill c - 20 would take on more credibility , gain wider acceptance , and certainly not lack for clarity were the questions acceptable to parliament actually specified in it , as well as the definition of " clear majority . " 
the only objection i can see to this proposal is based on interference . 
however , since the bill is one of interference anyway , to the point of disallowance , why not come clean and simply say , in words anyone can understand , that any province that wants to negotiate secession must first ask the following question and no other , and gain a specified percentage of favourable votes and nothing less . 
some hon. senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senator lynch - staunton : 
in november 1999 , the prime minister quoted from the september 3 , 1998 issue of le devoir , in which former quebec premier jacques parizeau suggested that the question be : " do you want quebec to become a country ? " 
the prime minister said , " i have no problem with a clear question like that . " 
if the arch - federalist and the arch - separatist have found common ground , i for one lean to amending the bill to include the question they agree to . 
as for a clear majority , i favour a minimum of two thirds of eligible voters . 
it is only fair for all parties to know ahead of time that the rules of a very dangerous game are deliberately made so strict that few would dare play it . 
those who object to clarifying the referendum question and establishing a clear majority will say provincial jurisdiction must be respected . 
i fully agree , but bill c - 20 ignores this . 
not only does it permit the rejection of a question adopted unanimously by a provincial legislature , but it permits the rejection of the results of a democratic vote . 
if this is not boldfaced meddling , nothing is . 
this is why the parliament of canada , which has no interest in doing the groundwork for secession , would be better advised to confirm its disdain for such a possibility by formulating the only valid question and specifying what constitutes a clear majority in advance . 
on this basis , few will try their luck , unless it is obvious to all that reconciliation is out of the question and rupture inevitable . 
then and only then should the question be put . 
the bill also requires the following : 
... an amendment to the constitution of canada would be required for any province to secede from canada which in turn would require negotiations involving at least the governments of all of the provinces and the government of canada . 
how naive can one get ? 
does the government really think that , having accepted by its own definition a clear answer to a clear question , the seceding province would wait for the months if not for the years it would take to complete negotiations before seeking international acceptance for what has been accepted by no less an authority than the government of canada itself ? 
the house of commons agrees , again to quote from the bill , that " there has been a clear expression of a will by a clear majority of the population of a province that the province cease to be part of canada . " 
then what ? 
does the federal government really think that , during all this time , the province would continue carrying on as if it were a full member of the federation ? 
has the government ever thought of the chaos that would ensue as a result ? 
to ask the question is to answer it . 
anyway , the supreme court did answer this question in the last paragraph of its opinion , when it stated : 
although there is no right , under the constitution or international law , to unilateral secession , that is secession without negotiation , this does not rule out the possibility of an unconstitutional declaration of secession leading to a de facto secession . 
the ultimate success of such a secession would be dependent on recognition by the international community , which is likely to consider the legality and legitimacy of secession having regard to , amongst other facts , the conduct of quebec and canada , in determining whether to grant or withhold recognition . 
thus , de facto secession through a declaration of secession is a real possibility , especially following a successful victory for the yes side in a referendum . 
the naivet é of the bill is found throughout . 
it specifies that , as there is no right to unilateral secession , an amendment to the constitution would be required to make it legal . 
in its unhelpful way , the court refused to pronounce itself " on the applicability of any particular constitutional procedure to effect secession unless and until sufficiently clear facts exist to squarely raise an issue for judicial determination . " 
the court invokes what it calls " the usual rule of prudence in constitutional cases " to explain its refusal . 
constitutional experts appear to be divided as to which procedure is applicable between the 7 - 50 one and the unanimous one . 
what about bill c - 110 , respecting constitutional amendments , which was given royal assent at the end of 1995 ? 
the bill was introduced by the prime minister as another of his post - referendum sops . 
in it , not only is quebec ' s traditional veto restored , but it is extended to ontario , british columbia , two or more of the atlantic provinces that have at least 50 per cent of the population of all the atlantic provinces , and two or more of the prairie provinces on the same basis , which in effect gives alberta a veto also . 
here is how the prime minister explained the bill . 
he said , in 1995 , as reported at page 16973 of hansard , that it : 
... requires that the government of canada first obtain the consent of quebec , ontario and two provinces from both the western and atlantic regions representing 50 per cent of the population of each of those two regions before proposing a constitutional amendment to parliament . 
the amending formulae in the constitution are tailored to specific cases . 
as secession is not in the constitution , the court has held that " each option " - that is amending option - " would require us to assume the existence of facts that , at this stage , are unknown . " 
bill c - 110 answers the question if the prime minister ' s explanation still holds , namely that the consent of at least six provinces , each with a veto , including quebec , is required before any amendment is brought before parliament , including that of secession . 
coincidentally , in his submission to the senate committee studying bill c - 9 , the nisga ' a bill , former justice willard estey pointed out the following : 
the canadian constitution may be amended by the formula set forth in part v of the constitution act , 1982 . 
the nisga ' a constitution may be amended if 70 % of those nisga ' a citizens voting in a referendum approve . 
this then supplants the amending formula in the canadian constitution ... 
i can only assume then , that the constitutional amendment act , bill c - 110 , also supplants the constitution . 
what is the result ? 
a unilateral imposition of an unenforceable constitutional amending formula guaranteeing that no major changes to the constitution are possible . 
quebec , having decided to secede , never a signatory to the constitution act , 1982 , will nonetheless be allowed to sit on both sides of the negotiating table as its determination to leave the federation is being discussed , and with a veto at hand at all times . 
the long and the short of it is that this bill is just what many people - especially those whose favourite sport is quebec - bashing - want , and just what a growing number , not the least of them quebec ' s federalists , do not want . 
the march 12 , 1998 issue of le devoir quotes the prime minister as saying : 
jean charest believes firmly in canada and in quebec . 
he is an ally whether he is leading the progressive conservative party or running for the leadership of the liberal party of quebec . 
one of the first to condemn bill c - 20 was that very ally , mr. charest . 
here is how mr. charest reacted to bill c - 20 as quoted in the november 30 , 1999 globe and mail : 
the polarization between ottawa and quebec has placed the quebec liberals in a serious dilemma . 
while the rest of the country was dealing with secession , the quebec liberals found it impossible to build a case for changes to the federation , mr. charest argued . 
he acknowledged that it was difficult to concentrate on changing the federation while a separatist government was in power in quebec . 
but he insisted that this is the issue ottawa should be focusing on rather than the hard - line strategy toward quebec known as plan b . 
do we make the country work rather than focussing on the break - up scenario , in other words , plan a rather than plan b ? 
that mr. bouchard should vent his spleen on bill c - 20 is to be expected , but that mr. charest , whose commitment to federalism is unquestioned , be put in such an awkward position that his chances of winning the next election may be seriously compromised , reminds one of the saying , " with friends like that , who needs enemies ? " 
bill c - 20 is based on the false assumption that quebecers can be identified as either separatists or federalists , when in fact the majority are deeply committed to quebec without in the least reducing their attachment to canada . 
what they seek is a greater role and greater control over the handling of their own affairs , a goal sought by many other provinces over the years , and still today . 
bill c - 20 will not draw the moderates closer to federalism per se , believe me , honourable senators . 
the mover of bill c - 20 in this chamber happens to be from nova scotia which , by his own admission , he would prefer representing in the house of commons rather than here . 
as he told us on thursday in so many words , this place is in the end but the handmaiden of the other . 
his preoccupation with the possibility of secession is understandable , as nova scotia was never really satisfied when it joined the federation . 
in fact , the first attempt at secession was made in nova scotia . 
the separation movement there came to a head in 1868 . 
although there was no referendum , 31,000 of the 48,000 electors in nova scotia signed a petition in favour of separation . 
as david matas points out in an article in the fall 1995 edition of the mcgill law journal : 
there was no question at the time that the will of the people was on the point : a referendum against confederation would have undoubtedly succeeded . 
on top of all this , all but two of the 38 members of the legislative assembly voted in favour of the petition for separation , and 16 of the province ' s 19 members in the house of commons signed the petition for separation . 
was the petition clear ? 
it certainly was . 
that there being no statute of the provincial legislature confirming or ratifying the british north america act , and it never having been consented to nor authorized by the people , nor the consent of the province in any other manner testified , the preamble of the act , reciting that this province has expressed a desire to be confederated with canada and new - brunswick is untrue , and when your majesty was led to believe that this province had expressed such a desire , a fraud and imposition was practised on your majesty . 
thus , here was a clear question on secession and a clear majority in favour of the clear question . 
if bill c - 20 had been in effect at the time , canada would have gone down the slippery slope of negotiating nova scotia ' s breaking away from canada . 
what is more , had bill c - 20 been in effect in 1868 , senator boudreau , the sponsor of the bill , would not be here waiting to run in the next election , waiting to take his place in the next liberal cabinet . 
how dreams of greatness can be dashed by ill - advised and provocative legislation which is bill c - 20 . 
i wish now to quote from donald creighton ' s biography of sir john a . macdonald : 
the object of howe ' s mission to england was the repeal of the union so far as nova scotia was concerned . 
macdonald refused to discuss such a subject officially . 
the only concessions that he ever considered making were small adjustments , chiefly financial , inside the unaltered frame of the union . 
he was willing to bargain about these , but about nothing more . 
there were those who argued that the best plan would be to persuade the nova scotians to give the new system " a fair trial " , with the inevitable implication that if they continued to dislike the union at the end of the trial , they would be free to withdraw from it . 
" that , it seems to me , " macdonald wrote bluntly to jonathan mccully , " would be giving up the whole question . 
the ground upon which the unionists must stand is that repeal is not even a matter of discussion . " 
some hon. senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senator lynch - staunton : 
the ability to negotiate , to be flexible and , yes , to be sometimes ambiguous , has , since 1867 , been the genius of the canadian federation . 
this is lost to us with bill c - 20 . 
parliament ' s role is at all times to take measures which not only do not jeopardize the unity of the country but , rather , enhance it . 
bill c - 20 opens the door to secession . 
it uses a questionable supreme court opinion giving respect to secession a legality sanctioned by the one body which should not be entertaining the subject , except to reject it without condition . 
bill c - 20 does not do that as presently worded . 
if for no other reason , it deserves to be rejected on this basis alone . 
however , if what senator boudreau tells us is true , that this is the most important bill for canada that we will consider in many years , then perhaps it is up to us in the senate to ensure we are not dealing with a possibility of separation with half measures which i believe this bill , as presently written , represents . 
if this government does not have the vision and the necessary policies to build canada in the 21 st century , then let us at least ensure that its negative and pessimistic approach to the future of canada as represented by this bill is altered enough that no province will dare advance the issue of separation unless there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of this country . 
let us amend this bill - put clarity into this so - called clarity bill - so that the bar will be raised to such an extent that this bill , i hope , will never , ever be used . 
i believe that if we must have a bill c - 20 - and i will never agree with the defeatist attitude of this government and agree that we need it - then let us insert right in the bill both the " specific and clear " question and the exact minimum majority support required before parliament must deal with the results of the referendum . 
our role is to put obstacles in the way of those who want to break up the federation for reasons arising out of constant grievances that can easily be worked out rather than the legitimate ones that are insoluble within the present federal system . 
bill c - 20 opens the possibility of secession at any time . 
my proposal would only allow it to be pursued when it is inevitable anyway . 
while i have amendments along the lines suggested , i will hold them back until a full discussion on the merits of these proposals has taken place . 
then , as i have suggested , let us amend it , so that secession will become virtually impossible . 
if we do not reject it , let us amend it so that secession becomes virtually impossible . 
this government can then forget about fighting past battles and get on with the job of governing - the job it was given by the electorate , and a job that it continuously fails to take up . 
some hon. senators : 
hear , hear ! 
hon. anne c . cools : 
honourable senators , i wish to ask a question . 
obviously senator lynch - staunton has done substantial work on his speech and has put before the senate a very thorough range of the history of canada in respect of this matter . 
the honourable senator told us that the supreme court of canada has said that there is no constitutional authority for secession , that it is not countenanced by the bna act . 
i wonder if the senator addressed that particular question in his research . 
i understand it is a difficult question , one that makes giants into dwarfs and one around which there has been a fair amount of timidity . 
however , i have wondered for quite some time now if , as former mr. justice estey told us , sections 91 and 92 form the total - 100 per cent i think his words were - powers of the government , both of canada and the various provinces , where does the power of any provincial government come from to promote secession ? 
senator lynch - staunton : 
honourable senators , any government can promote the political option that it was put in power to promote , such as in the case of the parti qu é b é cois . 
where does it get the authority ? 
i suppose that in a democracy such excesses must be accepted , unless it can be proven that the use of the money is really aimed at the breakup of a country , which in this case has yet to be done . 
i deplore the use of taxpayers ' money for the promotion of secession , but it is legally acceptable . 
permissible , i assume so ; whether it should continue , of course not . 
senator cools : 
honourable senators , i appreciate that answer from senator lynch - staunton . 
i also understand the sensitivity and the delicacy of the matter . 
we are essentially hearing from the media , from all of the political persons and most players , that the government of quebec is right because it has done it . 
it has the power to do it because it took that power . 
therefore , the government of quebec can use taxes to promote secession because it has been doing it and no one has really directed an alternative response at them . 
my next question was to be the other half , but the honourable senator has answered the other half of my question in his remarks . 
i have a minor question , and not a question of policy . 
the senator cited a particular case , i believe he said it was from 1916 . 
does the honourable senator have the name of that case ? 
senator lynch - staunton : 
if i recall correctly , 1916 was in reference to regulation 17 in ontario . 
senator cools : 
the honourable senator lynch - staunton had been laying out the historical development in a systematic and chronological way . 
i saw that as such an important matter that perhaps the name of the case should be placed on the record . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
honourable senators , i do not have it with me , but it was not regulation 17 . 
that was in 1912 . 
in 1916 , the privy council ruled the constitutional rights of french , and limited it to the courts and to the quebec and federal parliaments . 
it was a judgment of the judicial committee of the privy council . 
senator cools : 
it was a decision of the judicial committee of the privy council , i see . 
when this bill gets to committee , perhaps a useful part of the committee ' s study would include a review of the development of the relationship of the powers between the central government and the provincial governments as they were substantially altered by the judicial committee of the privy council . 
i am putting this on the record so that the record can show that it was the courts that fundamentally altered the constitution of this country . 
the difference between those instances and these instances is that at the time that those events were taking place i believe canadian constitutionalists condemned the actions of the judicial committee of the privy council in england . 
whether it was the great constitutional giants , whether it was william p . kennedy or any of these individuals to a person , including the late frank r . scott , to a scholar they all condemned the involvement of and the exercise of these powers by a court in a distant place in reducing the powers of the federal government and reallocating those powers to the provincial government . 
if we were to move on in this subject matter , a very important question that the committee will need to study on this particular bill - because this issue is causing me enormous distress - is at what point in the development of the constitution of canada did those newly acquired provincial powers get converted into the powers to promote and now , by bill c - 20 , to negotiate the disunion of canada ? 
once again , honourable senators , for the record i shall say that canada is one and indivisible . 
her majesty ' s governments are one and indivisible . 
hon. j . bernard boudreau ( leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , i have a brief question . 
i commend the leader of the opposition for a well - researched and ably delivered speech . 
the views , for the most part , were clear to me . 
i am sure they are honestly held and i respect the honourable leader of the opposition for that and for the opinions he expresses . 
as senator lynch - staunton began his remarks , i understood that his very fundamental opposition to this bill would be based on his firm belief that under no circumstances should the government of canada entertain secession negotiations or discussions . 
if 95 per cent of the population of quebec voted in favour of secession given a perfectly clear question and with a perfectly clear response , even under those circumstances , the honourable leader would believe as a matter of principle that the government of canada should not entertain any negotiations on secession . 
subsequent to that , there was mention of a figure . 
when the honourable senator referred to a level , he referred to two - thirds of eligible voters . 
of course , the leader of his party has indicated a level of 50 per cent plus 1 . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
honourable senators , i would prefer that we not discuss secession here . 
i would prefer to see a constitutional amendment disallowing secession , but that is impossible in the near future anyway . 
if we must have the subject before us , let us make the rules so strict that we make secession impossible . 
in effect , we would tell the provinces that secession will only come about when every other avenue of negotiation , discussion , compromise and consensus has been exhausted . 
if the situation becomes so untenable and even insoluble that there is no other avenue , then there is no other alternative . 
as for the level of two - thirds , that is a question of opinion . 
i throw out two - thirds because i think the bar must be very , very high . 
the question must be specific . 
i can think of no one , other than mr. parizeau and a few people in the p é quiste government now , who would dare ask that question . 
they will certainly ask a lot of others , but no one there , realistic as they are , would ask the direct question . 
there is the answer . 
right now , it is very comforting to federalists , but it should not be taken for granted . 
if we are to play this very dangerous game of establishing rules of secession , which is not our responsibility , let us play hardball . 
let us raise the bar so high that no one can get over it , unless a referendum becomes useless and a constitutional amendment meaningless because we have reached the stage where secession is inevitable anyway . 
it will take place other than through a referendum and legalities . 
senator boudreau : 
i thank the honourable senator for that answer . 
if this situation ever arises - and we all hope and believe that it never will - there will be differing opinions on where the bar should be set . 
i seemed to hear from the honourable leader of the opposition that he had a fundamental , principled objection to the government of canada entertaining , under any circumstances , the notion of negotiating secession . 
that is quite different from a position which says that the bar should be very , very high . 
does the honourable senator hold the view that under no circumstances should the government of canada entertain discussions on secession , regardless of the results ? 
senator lynch - staunton : 
in my view , it is not up to the federal government even to entertain the notion that this country can be broken up . 
some hon. senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senator lynch - staunton : 
that should be the motto of every government and has been , until this one . 
this government leans on the supreme court opinion , which is flawed , incomplete , contradictory and which says that under certain conditions which we will leave up to you to decide , secession can take place . 
now we are faced with a bill that is vague , incomplete and contradictory . 
senator kinsella : 
the government should not have brought it in . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
that is quite right ; the government should not have introduced it . 
if they want to confirm their distaste for secession , they should say to those who preach it that these rules must be obeyed before they will even consider talking to the secessionists about it . 
i would rather the government say , " as long as we are in power , we are not here to preside , " and i am paraphrasing dean peter hogg , " over the dissolution of the federation . " 
it is a simple as that . 
honourable senators , this bill makes that option legal . 
the supreme court legitimized it . 
now the government wants parliament to make it legal . 
i think that is a recipe for disaster . 
hon. fernand robichaud : 
honourable senators , the leader of the opposition tells us that the federal government must take a hard line and not consider the possibility of secession . 
it could therefore say that it would never agree to consider a referendum on this question in any province . 
would you go that far ? 
senator lynch - staunton : 
honourable senators , if the wish is for parliament to give an opinion on the secession question , it should set ground rules that are so stringent that nobody would be tempted to try their luck . 
the notion of secession ought not to enter the picture at the federal government level until all other possibilities of keeping the province within the federation have been tried and explored without any positive results . 
any discussion , negotiation , compromise or consensus ought not to take place until there is an awareness of the inevitability of the desire to separate . 
if a referendum is held without the conditions being known from the start , where are we headed ? 
how can anyone envisage negotiating a constitutional amendment with a province for years , when it has already decided to separate and with a federation which can do nothing more , because its actions might lead to the breakup of the country ? 
if quebec decided to declare independence , what would happen to the atlantic provinces , or to the western provinces , which would find themselves dominated by ontario ? 
this would inevitably lead to a very explosive situation . 
parliament has a responsibility to speak out categorically against secession . 
it should address the issue only when secession appears inevitable . 
today , it should say a categorical no . 
by discussing the matter at this time and in the weeks to come , i imagine , we are going to make the people in quebec who want secession very happy . 
we are going to play along with them . 
we are going to discuss conditions , amending formulas , formulas of what is to be included in the question , what is a majority . 
how can the parliament of canada spend weeks discussing such hypothetical questions , as if we had no other priorities ? 
this is beyond me . 
honourable marcel prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , i hardly need say that i have listened most carefully to the speech of senator lynch - staunton . 
i am always afraid of people who talk of impossibility , of indissolubility . 
it is a bit like galileo , who knew very well that the earth revolved around the sun . 
he was condemned for this , but it was later realized that he was right . 
indissolubility is of great concern to me . 
despite what we want to see in canada , many countries have become independent since 1945 . 
the leader of the opposition said he was considering proposing an amendment on a clear question . 
i do not even want to ask one . 
this is perhaps the only point on which i might agree with senator cools . 
i believe canada is one and indivisible . 
we already have problems , but we will have more . 
while preserving the country ' s unity , we must stop boasting all over the world about canada if we cannot work to recognize its specificities . 
the honourable senator said he would like a tough and clear question such as : " do you want quebec to become a country , yes or no ? " 
i do not like such a question , but at least it is clear . 
we can have a relatively short debate , a conclusion and an agreement . 
the honourable senator alluded rather quickly to the notion of " two thirds " . 
this is debatable . 
did he mean two thirds of the voters ' list or two thirds of those who actually vote ? 
senator lynch - staunton : 
both . 
senator prud ' homme : 
let me give you some statistics on voters in montreal ridings . 
did you know that 93.34 per cent of quebecers voted at the last referendum ? 
this is an exceptionally high percentage in the western world . 
in some parts of certain ridings , such as d ' arcy - mcgee , 99 per cent of voters voted , with almost 99.3 per cent of them voting no . 
it is their democratic right . 
is this not enough for you ? 
in the amendment he is considering , would he go so far as to say that all those who do not vote will , in any case , be included in the percentage ? 
is this what he really said ? 
senator lynch - staunton : 
yes , i did indeed say that a clear question ought to be included in the bill . 
also , the minimum number of votes ought to be specified before the process goes any further . 
i suggest two - thirds of those eligible to vote , not of those who cast their votes . 
in my opinion , 50 per cent or 51 per cent is not enough if what is at stake is the breakup of a country . 
two - thirds would be the allowable minimum . 
if we get to that stage , i have no doubt that the participation rate will be far higher , and the results will reflect it . 
senator prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , since the amendment has not been moved , can the honourable senator help us in our reflection ? 
i dare not say it is his . 
after speaking about a clear question and the requirement of two - thirds of the votes , he says no more . 
would he be prepared in his reflection to stop there , instead of adding one more difficulty that does not exist anywhere in the world ? 
as for the two - thirds figure , ten per cent of people on a voters ' list are not going to vote . 
they count as if they had voted . 
i like people to be tough when we are dealing with a country and when we know the consequences . 
i ask the honourable senator to reflect on that point . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
honourable senators , if i deliberately did not read the amendments , it is because i am throwing them out as a topic for discussion only . 
i hope they will be discussed at committee stage , as well as the honourable senator ' s arguments and those of other senators . 
we will decide whether to move amendments after discussions . 
senator cools : 
honourable senators , i had deferred to my leader , senator boudreau , but i was not finished . 
in my question to senator lynch - staunton , it occurred to me that , perhaps , i could have made it clearer for those who will read these debates . 
i was speaking to the historical developments of the constitution act while in the hands of the judicial committee of the privy council in england . 
on reflection , perhaps i should have described it as some of the historians have described it , namely , as the contest between sir john a . macdonald and lord watson . 
lord watson was the chairman of the judicial committee one of singular legal mind to whom was attributed the business of reconfiguring the constitution of canada . 
my question to senator lynch - staunton concerns precisely bill c - 20 . as i said before , i was a supporter of former prime minister trudeau , and i still am . 
in a 1991 speech about former chief justice bora laskin , mr. trudeau vigorously condemned what the supreme court of canada did with the patriation reference back in 1980 . 
mr. trudeau made the point that , try as he did , he could not succeed in having a debate on the question of where the sovereignty of canada rested . 
my concern about bill c - 20 is that it is creating a legal scheme or legal regime which , essentially , will authorize the secession of a province through a bilateral negotiation and agreement between the government of canada and the government of that province . 
in this instance , as i said earlier , the opinion of the house of commons is the opinion of the government of canada . 
if we are not careful , the entire question of secession will be reduced to a bilateral agreement and to a bilateral negotiation between the government of canada and the government of quebec , which is most improper . 
has the honourable senator given this matter any thought , or has he reviewed it in his research ? 
senator lynch - staunton : 
far be it from me to explain the bill , but i think the answer is that the house of commons is called upon to play a role in the preliminary stages in assessing the question . 
if the question is assessed as favourable , then the house will assess the answer . 
if it supports the answer , then it is out of the picture . 
what happens , as i read it , is that under clause 3 ( 1 ) an amendment is necessary and all provinces and the government of canada must participate in the drafting of that amendment . 
that is what draws the rest of the country into the ultimate breakup of the country . 
senator cools : 
essentially , the committee will have to look at that question . 
what you are saying is that the bill lays out a method for much later , but canadians are not consulted as to whether it should happen . 
hon. douglas roche : 
if the purpose of senator lynch - staunton ' s speech was to show clearly that his opposition to the bill is principled , fundamental and does not rely on discussion of the senate ' s role in the determination of clarity , since he hardly mentioned the word " senate " in his address , then senator lynch - staunton certainly succeeded . 
he made that clear . 
however , because the role of the senate in participating in the deliberations on the establishment of clarity is controversial , would the senator give us his views on the manner in which the bill speaks about the role of the senate ? 
i am sure senator lynch - staunton has strong views on this since he indicated earlier that this is a concern . 
perhaps he is leaving this provision for another member of the caucus to address . 
however , at this central moment in the debate , will senator lynch - staunton give us his views on the senate and also give us his view as to whether the bill is fixable by strengthening the role of the senate in the determination of clarity ? 
senator lynch - staunton : 
yes. 
i did not refer to the senate as such because others in the caucus will . 
i found the speech too long and there were many other things i would have liked to include in it . 
to speak just on the senate alone would have taken me quite a few minutes . 
senator kinsella , in particular , will address that particular feature of the bill . 
i urge all senators to be here because he will set out very clearly how the senate has been slighted , what its true role is and where we should be in this process . 
hon. herbert o . sparrow : 
honourable senators , i understand there are a number of reasons senator lynch - staunton wishes to see the bill defeated . 
one sufficient reason , in his opinion , stated now , is because of the role of parliament in the process . 
is the honourable senator suggesting that we make amendments to the legislation , and even if those amendments are passed , he would still vote against the bill as amended because he is opposed to the overall principle of the bill ? 
senator lynch - staunton : 
if the amendments were along the line that i suggested , i would have many fewer problems in supporting the bill when it came to third reading . 
i would prefer that the bill not be before us . 
however , if we can pass a so - called secession bill where the rules of a very dangerous game are so difficult to apply that they are practically impossible , and if we can act deliberately as a signal to those who want to break up this country that we will not be part of the process , then i would be willing to support that kind of legislation . 
hon. joan fraser : 
honourable senators , i have a question for senator lynch - staunton . 
i am a little troubled by one thread of his argument and by some of the questions . 
i believe one of the great glories of this country is that our constitution does not say that canada is indivisible , as does the french constitution and various other constitutions . 
it is one of the greatest qualities of this country that we do discuss these matters rather than fighting civil wars about them . 
i am troubled by the thread of my honourable friend ' s argument where he says we should not even talk about secession , and if ever it becomes impossible to avoid talking about it , we should play hardball . 
am i right or wrong when i discern in that line of argument that quebec , or any province for that matter - but his province , like my own , is quebec - should not be allowed at all to secede from canada ? 
senator lynch - staunton : 
let the parliament of canada make it clear that the only time it will be involved in a secession discussion is when all other avenues of keeping that province in the federation have been explored and have been found wanting . 
let us come in at the end , not start at the beginning . 
on motion of senator hays , debate adjourned . 
business of the senate 
hon. dan hays ( deputy leader of the government ) : 
as honourable senators know , this is a short day . 
there is one item further down on the orders of the day that i wish to ask leave to bring forward now . 
it is not government business . 
it involves a question asked of senator kirby by senator lynch - staunton about a condition that senator lynch - staunton wishes to see satisfied before we deal with this matter . 
accordingly , i ask for leave to bring this item forward now . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
honourable senators , is leave granted ? 
hon. no ë l a . kinsella ( deputy leader of the opposition ) : 
honourable senators , i find it passing strange that something else is happening here that is more important in the mind of the deputy leader of the government than government business . 
if that is his position , i have no objection . 
senator hays : 
honourable senators , i do not want to make a qualitative statement about the importance of any item on the order paper . 
sometimes , at certain hours of the day , bearing in mind there is not time for many more or any more speeches , it is appropriate to deal in an orderly way with the business of the chamber . 
my suggestion is an attempt to do just that . 
however , i understand senator kinsella . 
if leave is not forthcoming , then we will proceed with the orders of the day . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
is leave granted , honourable senators ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
state of health care system 
report of social affairs , science and technology committee requesting authorization to engage services adopted 
on the order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the honourable senator lebreton , seconded by the honourable senator nolin , for the adoption of the fifth report of the standing senate committee on social affairs , science and technology ( budget - study on the state of the health care system in canada ) presented in the senate on february 29 , 2000 . - ( honourable 
senator lynch - staunton ) . 
hon. michael kirby : 
honourable senators , i rise to respond to a question that senator lynch - staunton quite legitimately raised on march 2 with respect to the budget of the social affairs committee in relation to the study of the federal role in the health care system . 
in the question that senator lynch - staunton would have addressed to me had i been in the chamber at the time , he referred to a newspaper article that suggested - and he was extremely careful in his remarks to make it clear that he did not endorse the insinuation - that because i happen to be on the board of directors of a long - term care company , it was open to question as to whether i was in a conflict of interest . 
i happen to be on the board of directors of a company that is in the long - term care business . 
indeed , i still do not understand this perception . 
as i mentioned , senator lynch - staunton did not even suggest that there necessarily was a conflict . 
however , having said that , given the fact that some people think that there could be a potential conflict , senator lynch - staunton suggested , and i have taken up his suggestion , that perhaps the social affairs committee should adopt the process that i put in place when i was chairman of the banking committee and we were dealing with financial services legislation . 
i urged all members of the banking committee to table a similar letter outlining any relationships they had with financial institutions , just so that there would be no question about any conflict of interest . 
if a senator did have an interest in a financial institution , it would be publicly declared , since the intent was to make these letters available , as indeed they were , to members of the media who sought them from the law clerk . 
as it had not occurred to me that anyone could perceive a conflict in connection with the social affairs committee , it never occurred to me to adopt the same process in this instance . 
nevertheless , now that the issue has been raised , as soon as i read the transcript of senator lynch - staunton ' s comments in the senate i proceeded to do exactly what i did previously with the banking committee . 
i tabled a letter with the law clerk of the senate . 
that is a public document . 
the letter explicitly tells the law clerk that he can make it public . 
i also wrote to all the members of my committee and urged them to write such a letter to the law clerk . 
senator lebreton has already done so , and i presume that other members of the committee will do so in the future . 
as an aside , since i also sit on the subcommittee on communications of the transport and communications committee , i did the same thing with respect to that subject , even though senator lynch - staunton did not raise that matter . 
finally , every committee i have ever chaired has always attempted to reach a consensus on issues before the committee . 
therefore , only on very rare occasions have those committees been forced into a vote . 
we have always attempted to reach a consensus solution . 
i am happy to state publicly that if , in the course of deliberations on health care , a committee that i am chairing has to vote on an issue relating to long - term care or home care , i would abstain on the grounds that the company on whose board i sit is in that business . 
that has been the great strength of the banking committee over the years and i hope that it will become the strength of the social affairs committee as well . 
i believe that that responds to senator lynch - staunton ' s question . 
i should like to thank him for giving me the opportunity to put that on the record because it had not occurred to me that this could be an issue in this case . 
hon. wilbert j . keon : 
honourable senators , i have received senator kirby ' s letter and i am responding to it by disclosing all of my own pertinent information . 
hon. john lynch - staunton ( leader of the opposition ) : 
honourable senators , i wish to thank senator kirby for understanding the spirit in which my comments were made . 
it is important , in this institution in particular , that as full disclosure as possible is made . 
it is too bad that we do not have guidelines on this . 
we have nothing to hide here . 
i understand that the proposition never occurred to senator kirby until he saw the article , and i understand his reaction . 
however , others who saw the article would interpret it in the wrong way . 
this has cleared the air and i wish him success in the difficult task upon which he has embarked with the social affairs committee . 
senator kirby : 
i thank senator lynch - staunton for those comments . 
it was precisely the failure of the effort to establish a set of guidelines in this place several years ago that led me to take the ad hoc measure that i took with the banking committee . 
i would hope that the standing committee on privileges , standing rules and orders would take it upon itself to , at the very least , adopt the process that i have followed on an ad hoc basis on two occasions ; that is , simply as a matter of process , to have members of the committee table letters with the law clerk outlining outside interests they have with respect to the subject matter the committee of which they are a member is studying . 
i agree with senator lynch - staunton that that is the least we should do . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to and report adopted .

tributes on departure 
hon. john lynch - staunton ( leader of the opposition ) : 
honourable senators , while it is never a pleasant task to bid farewell to a colleague who has reached the mandatory retirement age , at least all can prepare for that inevitability . 
however , when a colleague decides to leave this place voluntarily , and with little warning , the loss is felt even more deeply . 
this could not be truer than in the case of senator ghitter , whose resignation takes effect tomorrow . 
i first met ron in 1976 , when we were both active in supporting the same candidate for the leadership of our party . 
i was struck then by his enthusiasm and dedication - qualities which , among many others , have benefited parliament for the last seven years , practically to the day , as he was appointed on march 25 , 1993 . 
ron ghitter brought with him experience and knowledge in law , in business and in politics as a former member of the legislative assembly of alberta . 
not least , he brought here an intense commitment to human rights , which has been marked by prestigious awards from the canadian council of christians and jews and from the alberta human rights commission . 
ron ' s contribution to the senate has been recognized by all sides because of his clearness of thought and forceful argumentation . 
his committee participation was highlighted by a most productive and effective term as chairman of the standing senate committee on energy , the environment and natural resources . 
ron has been particularly valuable in caucus , and all his colleagues will miss his thoughtful interventions . 
i will miss his loyalty and support . 
even when there was disagreement , his commitment to the leadership and to his colleagues always came first . 
more than one commentator in alberta has recognized ron ' s qualities and urged that they not be forgotten as a successor is being decided upon , confirmation that the stature and merit of our colleague is appreciated even in that province , which is the most critical of the senate as an institution . 
honourable senators , i cannot end without mentioning ron ' s wife , myrna , who is in the gallery and has been so supportive of his senate activities . 
i thank her for sharing ron with us . 
while we deplore his decision and accept it reluctantly , we understand . 
thank you , ron , for the last seven years . 
may you and myrna have many happy and active years together . 
as you prepare to leave here , know that you do so with much appreciation and a great deal of affection . 
hon. dan hays ( deputy leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , a statesman is one who can work for long - term goals that eventually suit situations as yet unforeseen . 
to me , this is exactly what my friend and colleague at the alberta bar , senator ron ghitter , did both in his public and his private life , and it is what he has come to represent . 
senator ghitter became who he is today through his many successful endeavours . 
he has achieved respect among lawyers in alberta for his expertise , in particular , in the area of land law and community planning . 
honourable senators , senator ghitter never allowed his professional or business best interests to obscure his humanitarian concerns . 
he is well respected because of his noteworthy work in human rights , as senator lynch - staunton has noted . 
his efforts in this area have earned him a number of awards and accolades , as was also noted , including the alberta human rights award . 
senator ghitter ' s principles are more important to him than politics . 
i remember his work with the dignity foundation , which he founded . 
from time to time , that work placed him in conflict with some of his former colleagues from the progressive conservative caucus . 
i suppose , honourable senators , that we all remember working with senator ghitter in his role as a politician , and a successful one . 
he was elected to the alberta legislature twice , establishing himself as such a good mla that he made a credible bid to become the leader of his party . 
senator ghitter combined his diverse skills into a powerful package in this place . 
he was always effective in his committee work . 
i suppose that those of us on this side often thought too much so . 
i think back to his time as chairman of the standing senate committee on energy , the environment and natural resources and the rough ride we got on the cepa bill . 
senator ghitter did his job well , proving his political acumen by rankling a good number of liberals and along the way joining senator spivak in establishing his " green " credentials . 
when senator ghitter announced his retirement to us and to albertans a short while ago , the impact was felt by my province . 
the calgary herald said how much senator ghitter will be missed and how we can all respect his decision to leave to pursue other endeavours . 
senator ghitter ' s compassion , skill , prudence and balance are qualities that are becoming all too rare in the public life of our home province . 
those who attack these notions do so not because they have any justification - in fact , it is quite the opposite . 
they are the harbingers of a new , more crass era of politics , one that senator ghitter fought against and one that proves senator ghitter ' s statesmanship , because his career had the unforeseen consequence of seeing him be a fierce adversary but , at one and the same time , a courteous one , something that newer politicians in many of our provinces do not understand . 
senator ghitter , it is a tribute to you that your province will miss you in public life , and , more important , that your departure signifies the loss of an important and valued contribution to the better governance of canada . 
honourable senators , i stand to say thank you to my colleague for all that he has done and all that he represents . 
i join senator lynch - staunton in thanking myrna as well for her patience and forbearance in letting ron make this very important contribution to public life . 
hon. norman k . atkins : 
honourable senators , i should like to add to the tributes to my good friend senator ghitter . 
as you may imagine , this is not a happy day for either myself or my colleagues on this side of the senate . 
i would even go further and venture to say that this is a day when the senate itself loses one of its most valued and able members . 
my colleagues will recount senator ghitter ' s accomplishments here , in private life and in the alberta legislature , so i need not dwell on them to a great extent . 
as the chairman of the progressive conservative senate caucus , i could always count on senator ghitter to bring whatever issues were before us into a clearer light . 
he was able to explain matters and his position on issues in words we could all understand and in most cases support . 
senator ghitter is an interesting contrast - a strong advocate for the rights of minorities , especially the less fortunate in our society , while at the same time believing in a compassionate form of fiscal conservatism . 
this split in his thinking and personality makes him a valuable contributor to legislative and policy discussions . 
sometimes tough issues were simply given to him to reflect upon so we would have the benefit of the views coming from this split personality . 
when these views were expressed , we really did not have to go further to seek other views . 
all options would have been canvassed by ron before giving us the benefit of his wisdom . 
senator ghitter was one i believed i could look to , as chairman , to help both open and close a caucus debate . 
his courage to speak out on issues that may have seemed to be unpopular at the time was best exemplified when he spoke out in the midst of premier klein ' s cost - cutting in a series of lectures and town hall meetings entitled " keeping the spirit alive , " during which he would deliver an address entitled " the alberta advantage - for whom ? " 
these lectures questioned the speed and depth of the alberta government ' s cuts and their effect on the most vulnerable portions of alberta ' s society . 
it was senator ghitter ' s belief that those on welfare , those with low - paying jobs , those needing rent - to - income housing and the elderly and the sick were paying an extraordinarily high price for the excesses of previous administrations . 
i should like to quote from one of these lectures given by senator ghitter because i believe it epitomizes his philosophy of government and the reasons why we will miss him so much in this place . 
it is always the challenge of good government to find and maintain the balance , a difficult thing to achieve in times of great change . 
government must somehow also find the courage to balance its brief present against the weight of the future , to do what it can and must do so that all , not just the privileged few , may share the opportunities it holds . 
honourable senators , history will record that government policies in alberta changed to move in the direction of helping those who once they hurt . 
this is no doubt due to timely interventions such as senator ghitter ' s . 
ron , i will miss you , your counsel , your humour , your pivotal role in our caucus , our dinners and our trips . 
i wish you and myrna all the best , as you set out to find new worlds to conquer . 
hon. joyce fairbairn : 
honourable senators , i should like to send my friend and colleague senator ghitter off today with congratulations for seven years of active service in this institution and assurances that his passion for human causes and his words of concern for the future of this institution will be remembered . 
senator ghitter and i are friends , even though we have squared off on different sides of political battles for a long time . 
he was tremendously involved in campus life . 
ron was a lot of fun , still is , and we have stayed in touch over these many years , not just because of the pull of politics but also because of other issues of mutual interest . 
as others have said , and i wish to underline , that in the province of alberta the name " ron ghitter " is synonymous with care and advocacy for the human and civil rights of all citizens - particularly those most vulnerable - be it issues concerning race , or gender , or sexual orientation , and the discrimination which follows that issue , violence in the community against women and children , or equality before the law . 
senator ghitter has spoken out eloquently in some of the most difficult of situations , when at times the easier course , personally or politically , might have been to remain silent . 
most recently , senator ghitter founded and co - chaired a human rights advocacy group called the dignity foundation in alberta . 
for all of this , he not only has endured spirited criticism over the years , but also received , as other colleagues have noted , great admiration and acknowledgement through awards from prestigious and well - respected organizations such as the canadian council of christians and jews and the alberta human rights commission . 
in political life , senator ghitter served two terms in the legislative assembly of alberta in the 1970 s . 
sometimes they did such a good job that they were viewed with interest by those of other political persuasions , but not always by their own colleagues . 
it took a lot of courage and spunk to fulfill that responsibility , and i always liked ron for doing it . 
he ran for the leadership of his party following mr. lougheed ' s departure . 
when that fell short , he went on to concentrate on law and business and the vibrant life of his beloved city of calgary . 
the health of the progressive conservative party , both provincially and nationally , has never ceased to be a major preoccupation for our colleague , and i know it will continue to be so as long as he draws breath on this planet . 
as an adversary , he is eloquent and smart and full of good cheer on the outside , but behind the scenes he is one of the toughest hombres that anyone could face . 
in spite of the battles , i have no doubt whatsoever that his goal always is for the greatest opportunities for the citizens of his city , of his province , and of his country . 
here in the senate , he combined his interest and his experience to serve on the committees which have been mentioned : the standing senate committee on legal and constitutional affairs , the standing committee on privileges , standing rules and orders , and the standing senate committee on energy , the environment and natural resources , where he was chair for three years from 1996 to 1999 . 
he came to care about the senate , but he has deep concerns about its viability in its present form , concerns which he expressed in a very fine speech in february of 1998 . he challenged all of us to work together constructively for change , both constitutional change and internal change . 
i read that speech again this morning , and i agree with much of it . 
i hope that we who remain may have the will to create the opportunity to push that kind of agenda for change forward in the months and years ahead . 
now ron heads back to re - energize a new phase of his life . 
he has a long way to go in the city that he loves with the woman that he loves , myrna . 
i should tell you , colleagues , that ron and myrna are a very active and popular team in their community . 
i wish them good times and happiness for many more years together . 
i know , ron , that you will always be in the forefront of the regrettably endless battle for equality of rights of canadians , wherever they live . 
you have been an asset to the senate , and i look forward a great deal to working with you on some of those causes and always continuing our friendship . 
hon. w . david angus : 
honourable senators , i should like to add a word of respect and friendship to the wonderful words that have already been said by honourable senators about ron ghitter . 
i first met ron in the fall of 1975 in calgary , and there ensued a period of some months when we worked together in the first leadership campaign of the right honourable brian mulroney . 
i came to know ron then as a man of great talent , integrity , and sound judgment . 
i found him to be not only a witty individual but also someone who could always be counted on in a tight squeeze and in any circumstances . 
from 1976 until 1993 , although we had occasional communications , we did not see much of each other . 
it was not until we were fortunate enough to be summoned to this place in 1993 that we met up again . 
the friendship we felt instantly rekindled itself to the point where i must share with you , honourable senators , that the saddest day for me since i came to this chamber was when i received ron ' s letter of february 17 saying that he would be resigning as of tomorrow and would no longer be with us . 
i confess to a moistening of the eyes . 
i went to see ron , but i failed in my most sincere efforts to get him to change his mind . 
it will be hard to get along without you , ron . 
ron came here in march of 1993 , and i came here in june of that same year . 
i happened to meet ron in the ottawa convention centre one afternoon . 
i was to be sworn in the next day . 
i expressed some concerns about the image of the senate as it was , at that particular time , in the midst of some terrible publicity . 
there ensued a four - hour tour of this city and the senate , its appurtenances and various manifestations , and everything he said was positive . 
whenever i have had a problem or wondered about something that may not be quite in line with the way my little world should be , i have gone to ron and asked for his balanced view and his judgment . 
you know when he looks you in the eye with that little grin that you are getting the straight poop . 
i cannot think of a more wonderful colleague , a more loyal friend , or a more sincere individual to have as a friend and colleague in this place . 
ron and myrna have already been kind enough to have invited us to their lovely home in calgary . 
his letter does say , as i reread it again today : " if your travels ever take you to calgary and you have a spare moment , please know that myrna and i will always have the welcome mat out . " 
i want you to know that i will be taking you up on that sooner than you think . 
i will really miss you , ron , and i hope that all goes well in your future endeavours . 
to both of you , godspeed and good luck . 
hon. ethel cochrane : 
honourable senators , i should like to join my colleagues in wishing a reluctant but fond farewell to senator ghitter . 
he has been a valued and highly respected member of our caucus . 
as you know , he has served with distinction in these years as chairman of the standing senate committee on energy , the environment and natural resources . 
i have admired senator ghitter ' s sincerity and honesty . 
i have also appreciated the energy , the diligence , and the thoroughness that he brought to all of his duties as a senator , and particularly to his work as chairman of the committee . 
senator ghitter ' s effort and enthusiasm , as well as his friendly and gentlemanly demeanour , contributed significantly to the success of our committee ' s work during his tenure as chairman . 
i regret that our caucus is losing the services of one of its most effective members , but i wish senator ghitter all the best in his future pursuits . 
hon. nicholas w . taylor : 
honourable senators , it is with mixed feelings that i rise today . 
ron and i go back many , many years . 
we have always been political opponents , but friends . 
many people have said today , " whenever i had a problem , i could go to ron . " 
my dilemma was different . 
whenever i had a problem , the last person i wanted to see was ron . 
he was a very formidable opponent who knew how to exploit any weakness i had in an argument . 
i sat next to senator ghitter when he chaired the environment committee . 
i was always pleased when i was able to anticipate one of his masterful manoeuvres , though i was not often able to do so . 
he is a tactician of many moves . 
i first remember ron as one of the best tennis players in alberta . 
he was a tennis professional for the glencoe club . 
he was famous for driving a ball so that it landed barely inside the line . 
he was the same in politics , firing shots that would land just inside the line . 
one could not get him on a point of order . 
i say mostly nice words about senator ghitter because earlier today , i agreed to be his prime roaster at a fundraiser for the conservative party in edmonton . 
that is something i am looking forward to with a little bit of glee . 
i hope all honourable senators will buy tickets . 
it will be an entirely different speech from the one i am giving today . 
ron and i cemented our friendship in the last few years . 
we used to commute back and forth from calgary in the good old days when there were two airlines serving this country . 
one had a hope of a good seat on the airline and to travel when desired . 
at times i would have to sneak on to the plane and pretend i had just run into him because he was always a model of sartorial splendour . 
if i was not wearing the right colour to match my suit , my wife would always say , " why do you not dress like ron ghitter ? 
he always looks perfect . " 
honourable senators , ron ghitter has been a great example to me in politics and also in private life . 
he has kept his quick wit and the reputation he earned in fighting for minorities . 
i remember that premier lougheed went out of his way to appoint ron ghitter to take my post , in a way , because as leader of the liberal party i could not get into the legislature to do the fighting . 
to that extent , i appreciate him . 
however , he was so good at it that i probably was the only political leader in the country who had to put down a revolt because they wanted to get someone from the opposite party to take over my party . 
there was no question that ron was that effective . 
honourable senators , senator ghitter brought that effectiveness into this chamber . 
lately , he has been fighting for the senate . 
with that , ron , i take my hat off to you . 
we will miss you here because you have been an adornment . 
god bless and good luck . 
hon. terry stratton : 
honourable senators , this is not one of the better days for me in the senate . 
those who have spoken before me have said all that can possibly be said about senator ghitter ' s capability and intelligence . 
i will speak from a more personal point of view . 
why does a man retire early ? 
senator ghitter is 10 years ahead of time . 
why is he leaving ? 
is he looking over his shoulder and not liking what is catching up to him ? 
as with us all , is it that same old guy who will eventually catch us all ? 
could it be that he does not love us or like us any more ? 
that is why i think he is retiring , to get a shot at four pensions . 
for the information of those senators who have been appointed more recently and to refresh the memories of those who came before senator ghitter and i , we were appointed on the same day - march 25 of 1993 . another coincidence is that at that time we received the phone call , each of us was threatened with bankruptcy by certain individuals who will go unnamed , but we are still here . 
as well , each of us was marched over to the 9 th floor of victoria building , looking out over wellington street and across to this wonderful hill . 
we were given offices side by side . 
they are small , but they have a wonderful view . 
the last coincidence is that we became friends . 
an old partner of mine told me not to use the word " friend " too loosely . 
he said that as one goes through life , one has many individuals who are acquaintances , but one has very few friends . 
even though we are parting and even though we may not see each other or talk for long periods of time , we will remain friends . 
i will not tell ron how wonderful , generous , intelligent and handsome he is because that has already been done . 
i take some issue with the handsome comments , however . 
senator ghitter ' s contributions to this chamber have been enormous . 
ron has a wonderful wife in myrna . 
how fortunate he is to have her . 
i shall miss sharing whiskey before dinner . 
i shall miss him tremendously . 
my irish presbyterian background tells me that i should not speak for too long , so i will not say anything about how good or wonderful he is because i do not like doing that . 
good - bye , ron . 
may the road rise to meet you and may the wind be always at your back . 
hon. david tkachuk : 
honourable senators , i shall not be long , either . 
i am actually kind of happy that ron is leaving . 
the reason for that is because i think he is happy he is going . 
i will not miss him as a friend because he is my friend and i do not live that far away from him . 
i will see a lot of him in calgary . 
i am a little upset at ron . 
i do not know whether he realized this fact after he wrote his letter of resignation and then it was too late , but today he will make some liberal in alberta very happy . 
what is even more upsetting is not only will he make a liberal happy , but the liberal will not feel any guilt because ron is still alive . 
that is a wonderful thing . 
as i said , honourable senators , i will not miss ron because i will still see him . 
i know that the party will not miss him . 
in fact , this is a happy day for the party because he can now be more involved in it . 
obviously , myrna will not miss him because he will be home more often . 
that is good for myrna ; and what is good for myrna is good for ron . 
we will miss you here and we will miss you in our caucus . 
we will miss your advice . 
most of all , in this place , we will miss your dignity . 
you are just a class guy . 
i want to wish you good luck . 
i am sure we will see each other in calgary , and perhaps we can have lunch together in one of those nice little restaurants . 
the senate will miss you . 
hon. j . michael forrestall : 
honourable senators , i want to thank myrna for many things over the years . 
marilyn also sends her appreciation . 
for those of you who were wondering , as was senator stratton , why senator ghitter would quit at age 65 , i can tell you that secret . 
it is his undying ambition to shoot his age in golf before he leaves this world . 
i hope he manages to do that , and i hope it is a 71 . 
we will track that record . 
that should happen at about the time i leave the senate . 
thank you for being a colleague and a friend . 
good luck . 
hon. douglas roche : 
honourable senators , my tribute to my fellow albertan ron ghitter , though brief - because everything i wanted to say about him has been said already - is heartfelt . 
ron ghitter has been an ideal senator . 
i looked up to him long before i entered this chamber . 
he has brought to the senate a vision for alberta and for canada , a deep understanding of the political process , and a drive to extend human rights for all . 
his contribution to the well - being of our whole society should live long after his departure . 
let us hope that the political legacy of senator ron ghitter will be a beacon for his successor , a successor who i hope will bring to the senate the desires of many albertans for a progressive , caring , and compassionate society . 
i hope his successor will stand up for human rights to be fully enjoyed by all who are now marginalized . 
may his successor understand intuitively that alberta and canada , in the 21 st century , in order to thrive and prosper , must be fully engaged with a world of dynamic change . 
those are the values of ron ghitter that i salute today . 
hon. lois m. wilson : 
honourable senators , i have only interacted with ron ghitter about four times since i came to the senate , mainly on the environment committee , but it was enough to show the measure of the man . 
i simply want to say i am impressed by his integrity and persistence . 
these qualities are very much needed by the human community . 
i congratulate you on those qualities , ron , and i wish you well . 
hon. gerry st. germain : 
honourable senators , senator ron ghitter has brought political balance to my life . 
a liberal senator who spoke earlier mentioned that there were moments of confrontation within our own caucus on political viewpoints . 
in that environment , i grew not only to respect ron but to really like him . 
you are one of the most decent guys i have ever met . 
those of us from the far west will really miss you . 
hon. ron ghitter : 
honourable senators - 
hon. senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senator ghitter : 
may i say that you have all been so wonderful in your remarks this afternoon that i have changed my mind and i will stay . 
hon. senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senator ghitter : 
i guess it is too late for that . 
i will have to carry on . 
thank you , honourable senators , for your generous and warm remarks . 
over the years that have i been privileged to sit in the senate of canada , i have often suggested that tributes to those retiring should be brief and limited . 
that was , of course , until today . 
how often your perspective changes when you are the target of the tributes . 
it is not often , as friends who know me well will attest , that i am left speechless . 
it happened when i married my dear myrna ; it happened at my daughter ' s wedding ; and i have the same feelings today . 
as i look back on the past seven years , in many ways i have become a very different individual from the person who entered this this chamber with senator stratton in march of 1993 . i have seen the magnitude and the diversity of this country through the eyes of many wiser than i who dwell in this house . 
i have travelled to areas of this great nation which were only names on the map to me . 
i have experienced politics in the big leagues here in ottawa , far different from the narrower confines of a provincial legislature . 
i have changed my views on many things , such as the election of senators . 
when i came here , i thought that was a good idea . 
i no longer think that . 
i have never toted a gun in my life , but i found myself speaking against gun control legislation and i still do . 
i have spoken on reform of the house of commons and even , thanks to senator spivak , i am now an environmentalist , god help me . 
that is what happens in this world . 
in the senate , i have experienced the lows one has from time to time when facing the necessity of starting a defamation action stemming from comments made about me in this institution , and the highs of many friendships that i have been blessed to make while being here . 
as my fellow senators from alberta can attest and as senator fairbairn alluded to in her generous comments , being a senator from that great province is a challenging and often bittersweet experience . 
i am also very proud to have been a member of the senate . 
i recall the first speech i made in this place when we sat on that side of this chamber , a much more pleasant side on which to sit . 
i wish we were there again , and one day we will be . 
i have to say that in all partisanship . 
i remember making my first speech . 
i was terribly nervous . 
i remember senator frith rising very graciously and , with great courtesy , suggesting that , if i would only slow down , he could keep up with what i was saying . 
he could hear it , but he could not understand what i was saying because i was speaking so fast . 
i recall , shortly after that , my wedding night to my wonderful , non - political myrna . 
that was my wife ' s first lesson on the life of a poltician and how we must live when we are involved in politics . 
bless her for understanding . 
i recall the intense work and debates on such important issues in this chamber as pearson airport , gun control , mmt , reform of the senate , even the absent senator thompson , and the environmental protection act , amongst many others . 
above all my many experiences here , some of which i enjoyed and some of which i did not , i have learned to respect the members of the senate of canada , their work , their commitment to their country , and their recognition of their constitutional responsibilities . 
yes , we need reform , just as the other place needs reform . 
however , in my view , and i state it wherever i go and will continue to do so , the continued existence of the senate of canada is essential to maintain the balance required in a nation as geographically diverse as canada , and to provide that second consideration of bills and programs away from the heated political rhetoric and posturing of the other place . 
there is no doubt in my mind that we must have a senate - and i do not mean an elected senate . 
i have expressed my views on that topic from this seat and in many other locations numerous times . 
we need experienced , wise and dedicated canadians like those who are here today to come to this place to share their wisdom and their intelligence in a cool , detached and , preferably , non - partisan manner to provide balanced regional representation . 
what is missing is that canadians often do not understand the value of this place that , too frequently , becomes a media whipping post on a slow news day . 
thus , it is our responsibility - and one i will continue to speak to - to prove the value of the institution of the senate to canadians . 
we are constantly on trial as we sit in this place , something which we must never forget . 
in conclusion , i should like to thank all honourable senators for being so gracious to me and for doing what they are doing . 
i leave this place with the greatest respect for all who come here to make their own unique contributions . 
to my colleagues on this side of the chamber , i will miss you all . 
it has been a marvellous experience coming to know you . 
to our leaders senator lynch - staunton and senator murray who served before him , you have served us all magnificently and with a deeply held conviction regarding the country , the senate and political roots . 
to you , your honour , and all the staff in senate offices and this chamber , i extend my thanks for all your help and guidance . 
i have been blessed to participate in a journey experienced by only 827 canadians since confederation . 
i am grateful to former prime minister mulroney for appointing me , and to all of you who have made my journey so memorable . 
i thank you all very much . 
hon. senators : 
hear , hear !

honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the second time ? 
on motion of senator hays , bill placed on the orders of the day for second reading on tuesday next , april 4 , 2000 . 
question period 
natural resources 
disposal of cape breton development corporation - proposal by community group to take over ownership of donkin mine 
hon. john buchanan : 
honourable senators , i have in my hand a letter - and perhaps the leader has received a copy of it - from a group located primarily in the glace bay - new waterford area . 
this group has formed a co - op with the help of father george neville to attempt to take over the donkin mine . 
steve farrell , a noted mining engineer who i think the minister knows , and who is probably one of a very few mining engineers with an incredible knowledge of the sydney coal fields , has also assisted in forming this co - op. 
as the minister knows , the donkin mine contains what is probably some of the best coal to be found in the sydney coal fields . 
in 1979 , the provincial government of the day , of which i had the honour to lead , brought a drill ship in and delineated the seams in the donkin area . 
subsequently , under the leadership of the honourable allan j . maceachen , two tunnels were drilled at a cost of a little over $ 80 million between 1980 and 1984 - 85 . 
those tunnels were flooded , and properly so , to preserve them . 
the tunnels are there , the coal is there , and it is ready to go . 
with the closure of the phalen colliery , a considerable number of miners will be displaced and moved over to the prince colliery . 
of course , a certain number of miners will be out of a job . 
they will receive severance pay , but will not have pensions or a job . 
hon. j . bernard boudreau ( leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , i thank the honourable senator for his question . 
i am familiar with the group to which he refers , although i believe it is father bob neville who helped with its formation . 
it is a community group looking at the possibility of conducting mining operations in industrial cape breton . 
as a consequence , it is offering employment opportunities to some of those miners who will receive neither a pension nor be employed in the existing coal industry with the new private - sector operator . 
i have not had a chance to review in detail the proposal , nor am i sure if all of its details have been fleshed out . 
they are not the only community group involved in this matter . 
there is at least one other community group that is expressing some interest in aspects of the existing coal field , and for essentially the same purpose . 
they wish to see if there is an opportunity to employ miners who will not be taken up by the new private - sector operator who will operate existing coal facilities . 
i have had an opportunity to make contact with at least two groups . 
i have informed both that we have a process underway to ensure that the main operations of devco will be taken over by a new private - sector operator . 
the potential operator will continue to operate indefinitely into the future and give employment to a large number of miners presently working there . 
that is the prime objective , and i believe that process has been an arm ' s length process . 
it is now reaching some critical stages . 
a number of private - sector concerns expressed interest in taking over devco ' s operations . 
we are down to a very short list . 
that process must be given priority in order to ensure that the main operation continues and that large numbers of coal miners will receive ongoing employment there . 
however , it is not necessarily inconsistent that other possibilities might exist . 
before we give them serious consideration and perhaps raise expectations to a point which may be unrealistic , we must see the plan of the successful private - sector operator . 
senator buchanan : 
honourable senators , i want to thank the minister for that answer . 
i have no argument with what is happening now . 
it will happen . 
we know that and we can debate the merits or demerits of the devco plan when bill c - 11 comes to the senate . 
hon. john buchanan : 
honourable senators , at the present time i have a great concern , as do many cape bretoners . 
they all use coal . 
there may come a time when they may convert to natural gas , although i am told by people in the industry that the cheapest method of generating electricity is still our own indigenous coal . 
there is a concern about the donkin mine getting off the ground , or under the ground , whatever you want to say . 
this is what i want the minister to check . 
the concern is that the proposal call from devco for a private operator to take over point aconi apparently includes the right for the successful company to market to the nova scotia power corporation 1 million tonnes of coal . 
in other words , what could happen here is that 1 million tonnes of coal that will be used in cape breton may very well come from places like hampton roads , virginia . 
the coal could come from the mines in west virginia and pennsylvania to hampton roads and then shipped to cape breton . 
honourable senators , i have been told that a foreign company , probably from the u.s. , will be taking over the point aconi plant , and that that company will have the right to then market the coal from wherever they wish . 
the coal will be brought to cape breton to power up the generating plants of the nova scotia power corporation . 
that , mr. minister , is something that we simply must check carefully and ensure , if possible , that it not occur . 
hon. j . bernard boudreau ( leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , certainly we want to maximize all of the coal resources in cape breton , and to create maximum employment opportunities . 
once we go through the process , we will have an operator who can achieve solid , long - term markets , be those markets with nova scotia power or with others . 
the private sector operator , i hope will be a company with solid financial substance that will provide security for those workers who accept employment with that company . 
the honourable senator is right in that as a general principle we must ensure that we maximize the resource , given that it needs to be done in an economically feasible way . 
part of the history of that coal field - and we are both very familiar with it - is that massive amounts of public money have gone there over the years to subsidize the production of coal . 
that will not happen again . 
therefore , at the end of the day , i am confident that the miners in cape breton , given the appropriate circumstances , will produce coal for a long time . 
they will do it at competitive prices and they will sell to the nova scotia power commission . 
i would not be at all surprised to see cape breton coal sold in places in the world other than nova scotia . 
senator buchanan : 
honourable senators , the minister has just touched upon the problem . 
when he says that there " will be " markets throughout the world for cape breton coal , he means there " may be " markets . 
the problem is that a market exists right now for approximately 1 million tonnes of coal . 
whatever the longevity of prince colliery , it will produce in the range of 1 million to 1.5 million tonnes of coal , maybe a little more . 
that still leaves the nova scotia power corporation short - something in the range of 1 million tonnes . 
the market is right there in cape breton at the present time . 
the claim is that approximately 200 miners could be employed in the new donkin mine . 
these investors claim - and this will have to be analyzed carefully of course - they will be able to finance with outside investment and some investment from inside nova scotia . 
honourable senators , if that is the case , why would the government of canada , through devco , allow that 1 million tonnes of needed coal to be brought in from outside ? 
why would the government of canada say to the new operator of the donkin mine - which would run by cape bretoners , or nova scotians , generally , " sorry , but you cannot sell your coal to the nova scotia power corporation , you must sell it " - as the minister just said - " somewhere in the world . " 
it will not equitable or fair , if that happens . 
it does not make sense . 
senator boudreau : 
honourable senators , i remain confident and assured that the process that is being conducted at the moment - and i say it is arm ' s length from government so i have no knowledge of the details of the process - will cover all of the probabilities of maximizing employment in that region . 
however , at the end of the day , it will be the miners ' ability to produce that coal , bring it to the surface and offer it for sale at a competitive price , that will determine how much coal will be sold to the nova scotia power commission and elsewhere . 
disposal of cape breton development corporation 
hon. lowell murray : 
i would like very much to see the mandate that the cabinet has given to the private sector organization that is representing the government in seeking the disposal of these assets . 
the minister also spoke of a future private sector operator , in the singular , which leads me to ask him whether it is the position of the government that all of the assets must be sold as one , and to a single purchaser ? 
the minister knows that there are a number of assets - the prince mine , the donkin property , the railway , the coal washing plant and so forth . 
is it the position of the government that it would not entertain proposals for one or other of the assets separately ? 
my friend knows that the co - op to which senator buchanan referred is seeking only to get one of those assets , namely the donkin property . 
i would appreciate it if the minister would answer that question . 
finally , has the minister received a request from this cooperative organization to meet with them , and if he has not done so , will he do so ? 
hon. j . bernard boudreau ( leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the prime motivation of the government is to maximize the potential employment in that area during the course of the divestiture . 
my comments referred to one private sector employer initially because a bidding process has gone on and , without question , there will be one major operator in the coal field . 
that company will emerge from this process . 
i am aware of at least two other groups that have expressed some interest . 
the particular group we are discussing here expressed some interest early on to me . 
my recommendation at that time was that they proceed through the process that was available . 
subsequent to that , very recently , they made contact again with my office , looking to speak to me . 
i have no difficulty speaking with them and meeting with them , as i will with at least one other group . 
the message that i have given to those groups is that we have a process in place and we cannot interfere with that process as it proceeds . 
during that process , a recommendation will be brought to the crown corporation and ultimately through to government , and that does not necessarily preclude other possibilities if they make sense . 
agriculture and agri - food 
farm crisis in prairie provinces - flooding problem in manitoba and saskatchewan 
hon. terry stratton : 
honourable senators , i hate to be repetitious in my questions , but i believe last week i had asked about help for the farmers who have been flooded out in southwestern manitoba and southeastern saskatchewan . the minister has promised over several weeks now that the case would be carried forward to the prime minister and that an answer would be forthcoming . 
i will be repetitious about this and ask again if any progress is being made in that area . 
hon. j . bernard boudreau ( leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , when the honourable senator stratton last raised this matter , i did some checking because i thought that a response had been tabled . 
my office indicated to me that on february 24 a response was tabled to the of the honourable senator ' s question . 
i do not know if senator stratton received the answer , but it did indicate some of the changes and some of the programs that were put in place . 
however , i indicated once again to the minister of agriculture that the honourable senator had raised concerns with respect to the farmers who were unable to plant last spring due to the flooding in southeastern saskatchewan and southwestern manitoba . 
i am prepared to make another copy of the response available . 
senator stratton : 
honourable senators , i keep asking this question because nothing specific has been done for that particular group of farmers . 
i understand that they do not qualify for aida , our disaster relief program . 
i appreciate what the government has done to help farmers across the country as a whole , but the extent of the relief given to farmers recently will not even pay for the increased cost of fuel for their farms . 
they are really in a predicament . 
my concern and consideration and questioning repeatedly must be specifically for those farmers . 
can we fit them into a government program that will help them ? 
according to the estimates for he next fiscal year , we will spend $ 552 million on disaster remediation for the saguenay region and the red river region . 
my guess is that the vast amount of that money will be spent on the ice storm . 
if we can give help in the form of $ 552 million next fiscal year and untold millions last fiscal year and the previous one - well over $ 2 billion or $ 3 billion - why can we not help these farmers in the same way ? 
senator boudreau : 
honourable senators , i will do what i should have done initially , which is read parts of the tabled response for the benefit of other senators . 
the government of canada has made a number of changes to existing safety net programs to help farmers who were unable to seed due to wet weather conditions last spring . 
in partnership with the government of saskatchewan , the government introduced a $ 50 per acre benefit for those with unseeded acres . 
this offer was also open to the government of manitoba as well . 
the government extended the seeding deadlines for crop insurance . 
the government changed the agricultural income disaster assistance ( aida ) program to allow farmers to get interim payments on their 1999 benefits earlier . 
the government adjusted the net income stabilization account ( nisa ) program rules to permit easier access to those funds . 
the aida program is designed to provide benefits to farmers who suffer severe income drops regardless of the circumstance . 
this would include farmers who are unable to seed due to wet weather . 
i understand that the honourable senator may not feel that this is a complete response to the situation , but it does reflect a response by the government of canada to that particular situation . 
honourable senators , i had the pleasure last week of meeting and having supper with the minister of agriculture from nova scotia , who was in ottawa , along with his provincial counterparts , to negotiate a new federal - provincial agreement with the federal minister . 
in fact , he went away from that negotiation most pleased that they were able to negotiate such an agreement and most pleased with the extent of the financial commitment that would apply to nova scotia . 
i cannot speak to every province , but for the province about which i had an opportunity to discuss with the minister of agriculture , i think they would be inclined to say that great progress has been made . 
combining the agreement that we saw here when the premier of saskatchewan and the premier of manitoba stood shoulder to shoulder with the prime minister to announce a new one - time program and the increases to the existing aida program that was put in place , i think the government has acted in a substantial way over the last number of months . 
foreign affairs 
china ' s human rights record - request for tabling of document outlining government policy 
hon. consiglio di nino : 
honourable senators , the u.s. state department recently tabled its 1999 " country report on human rights . " 
the report on china , which runs some 70 pages , states that china ' s poor human rights record deteriorated markedly throughout the year . 
this reports details numerous human rights violations , such as intensified efforts to suppress particularly organized dissent , increased control and manipulation of the press by the government , and continued restrictions on freedom of religion including intensified controls on some unregistered churches . 
will the leader of the government in the senate table the position of the government of canada on china ' s human rights record ? 
hon. j . bernard boudreau ( leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , canada ' s engagement with china on the issue of human rights is based upon three main pillars . 
we have also established a human rights symposium involving over 10 countries and the third round of that symposium will be held in thailand , in june . 
our human rights programs with china go beyond simple expressions of concern , consultations and visits . 
the canadian international development agency continues to develop numerous projects that are helping to build the rule of law in that country . 
one example is the training of judges . 
the canada - china human rights dialogue has allowed canada access to chinese agencies whose cooperation is essential to improving human rights practices in china . 
human rights 
china ' s record 
hon. consiglio di nino : 
honourable senators , i do not know how to put this gently . 
it certainly appears to me that great effort , energy and expense , has been expended by our country in this engagement with china , including all of these committees . 
i understand most of these committees operate behind closed doors . 
this secrecy has resulted in the deterioration of the process on these issues , including most recently the incredible action against the catholic church . 
we are not even talking about the falun gong , but the catholic church . 
the catholic church is not recognized by china because catholics believe in the pope . 
they are persecuting and putting in jail people who are trying to practise a religious freedom . 
it seems to me that since the engagement of this country in this dialogue , the actions of china are worsening . 
how does the leader of the government explain that ? 
hon. j . bernard boudreau ( leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , i would not entirely agree with the honourable senator ' s assessment that the situation in china with respect to human rights is getting worse . 
there are many instances in china where a canadian government could not possibly support and , indeed , would condemn the actions of government agencies in that country . 
the honourable senator has raised one of those areas in this chamber . 
as with other countries , the principle of contact and the efforts that we have made , while they may not yield the immediate results we all would wish , have , over a period of time , moved things forward , as they have with respect to other countries . 
ultimately , that sort of contact will be productive in many of the areas that the honourable senator raises . 
senator di nino : 
honourable senators , i have a great deal of sympathy with the minister . 
he is obviously presenting the party line , and i am sure he does not believe half of what he is reading . 
does the leader not feel that these meetings that are taking place should be held in public ? 
second , would it not be of value to have parliamentarians participate in these meetings so that they can bring back reports on what is happening ? 
senator boudreau : 
honourable senators , i take seriously the honourable senator ' s suggestion with respect to expanding the role of parliamentarians in some of these areas , and i will pass that suggestion along to government . 
we have seen unbelievable changes in the world in the past 10 years . 
if we look to eastern europe , we can see situations where the world today has moved at a pace that none of us would have believed possible 10 years ago . 
human rights improvements have been significant there . 
china has not moved as quickly as many of us would like in the field of human rights . 
the government of canada has taken every opportunity to speak on its position with respect to human rights and some of the incidents to which the honourable senator refers . 
contact and the efforts that have been made will exercise a positive influence and move the human rights issue forward . 
i believe the government will continue with these efforts , perhaps considering the suggestion that the honourable senator made with respect to the participation of parliamentarians on a wider basis . 
china ' s record - united states department of state report - government position 
hon. john lynch - staunton ( leader of the opposition ) : 
honourable senators , does the government of canada agree with the assessment of the department of state in its most recent annual report on the human rights situation in china , one of extraordinary pessimism that things are not improving ? 
the assessment of the state department is supported by ngos such as amnesty international , human rights watch , asia watch and others . 
i wish to know from the leader of the government in the senate , does the government of canada share the view on the situation of human rights in china as expressed in the last state department assessment ? 
hon. j . bernard boudreau ( leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , with the indulgence of the honourable senator , i wish to consult some notes i have here with respect to that matter . 
during a press conference on january 11 of this year , the state department of the united states announced that the clinton administration , as a result of some study and investigation that they had done , intends to present a resolution on china at the next meeting of the un to be held in geneva . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
honourable senators , as usual , the leader has not answered the question , but if he reviews the resolution , the resolution from the united states would be to condemn the human rights situation in china . 
will the government of canada support that resolution ? 
it is as simple as that . 
senator boudreau : 
i have indicated that the government of canada is now in discussions with other countries that will be facing that resolution . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
can you not make up your own mind ? 
senator boudreau : 
honourable senators , i do not know that the government has given a formal indication of what its position will be at that stage . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
typical ! 
senator boudreau : 
whatever decision is taken , the goal will be to improve the situation in china . 
the issue is simply what the most effective tactic might be to achieve that result . 
natural resources 
disposal of cape breton development corporation - effect of new technology to create hydrogen from coal 
hon. nicholas w . taylor : 
honourable senators , i have a question supplementary to senator murray ' s and senator buchanan ' s questions on cape breton . 
i am seeking information regarding the coalfields in sydney . 
i am not thoroughly familiar with them but , as a mining engineer who has operated in the coalfields in the rockies , the eastern coalfields do interest me . 
one of the things that has come over the horizon in recent times is the ballard cell which actually extracts hydrogen from hydrocarbon oil to drive vehicles . 
recent research shows that coal , and not oil and gas , may be the best fuel source . 
in other words , cape breton may turn out to be another saudi arabia down the road if this type of energy takes over . 
i am wondering about the government ' s analysis , knowing that governments are sometimes marching to a tune which quit playing 20 years earlier . 
when the government was evaluating cape breton , did it take into consideration the newest technology of hydrogen creation from coal ? 
that technology race is probably led by south africa right now but there is much activity in vancouver and the western part of canada . 
hon. j . bernard boudreau ( leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , i am not specifically familiar with that technology but i know that from time to time over the past decades , various technologies and new potential uses for coal have come to the fore . 
there is a huge reserve of coal in cape breton , and any new technology that creates a demand for that resource will be a positive sign . 
the fundamental decision - and i am not so sure there are many people who would disagree with it - is that the government of canada should not be in the business of mining coal . 
we have not done that well , and there are other examples where government has been in business where perhaps it should not have been . 
my hope is that if that sort of technology does come along , it will be utilized to the best advantage by a strong , well - financed , forward - looking private sector firm . 
in that way , the workers and the people of cape breton will receive the maximum advantage . 
royal assent 
notice 
the hon. the speaker informed the senate that the following communication had been received : 
march 30 , 2000 
mr. speaker , 
i have the honour to inform you that the honourable ian binnie , puisne judge of the supreme court of canada , in his capacity as deputy governor general , will proceed to the senate chamber today , the 30 th day of march , 2000 , at 5:00 p.m. for the purpose of giving royal assent to certain bills . 
secretary to the governor general 
the honourable 
the speaker of the senate 
orders of the day 
business of the senate 
hon. no ë l a . kinsella ( deputy leader of the opposition ) : 
honourable senators , would the deputy leader of the government walk us through the order of business for the rest of the day ? 
his honour has just indicated that , at 1700 hours , we will have the deputy of her excellency the governor general here for royal assent . 
all honourable senators would like to know at what time we will be adjourning to attend upon the deputy of her excellency . 
will it be at 4:45 ? 
as we look at the order paper , just what might be the order in which things will be called ? 
i would like to point out for the benefit of our colleague , the whip , that responsibility for the quorum concerns all honourable senators . 
it is a challenge for the government whip , because it is important to have a quorum for royal assent . 
if the deputy leader of the government could walk us through how he sees things being called , honourable senators might find that helpful . 
will we resume after royal assent , and should we anticipate coming back at eight o ' clock tonight or not seeing the clock at six p.m. ? 
hon. dan hays ( deputy leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , as the deputy leader of the opposition knows , sometimes it is difficult to be precise in estimating the time that is taken for tributes , for question period and senators ' statements , which we did not have today , but leave is often granted to extend time . 
we have under " government orders , " bill c - 9 . 
looking at the clock , we have roughly one and a half hours before five o ' clock , at which time we will rise to await the representative of her excellency . 
i am assuming the royal assent ceremony will take approximately half an hour . 
because we have a new governor general , letters patent for the authorization of her representatives from the supreme court of canada have to be read in full . 
if we intend to be serious in dealing with the order paper today , we will have to sit after the royal assent . 
i propose that we see where we are at that time . 
if at six o ' clock , we are still in session , i suggest that we not see the clock . 
senator austin will lead with a speech on bill c - 9 . 
i am not sure whether there is a response on the other side . 
if there is , i suspect that will take us close to five o ' clock . 
then senator fraser will be speaking on bill c - 20 . i assume that the opposition will hold the adjournment . 
i do not believe that she has a long speech . 
senator moore would like to address bill c - 10 at second reading . 
i suspect that , on item no. 4 on the order paper , bill s - 19 , the amendments to the canada business corporations act , we will not be hearing from senator tkachuk today . 
i know senator wilson wishes to speak to it . 
if she speaks , we will have to ensure that it does not interfere with senator tkachuk ' s 45 - minute time allocation . 
if that takes us to 6:30 or seven o ' clock , i suspect that we will be coming to the end of our day , given the observation that senators tend to travel on this day . 
there is one speech , however , that we would like to hear . 
i see senator angus is here and i know that he intends to speak to the marine liability legislation . 
i am not certain what his travel plans are , but if he is present in the chamber we will be pleased to hear his intervention . 
at that stage of our proceedings , i will ask leave to allow all remaining matters to stand until our next sitting , which , while i have not dealt with it yet , would , i anticipate , be tuesday next at two o ' clock . 
honourable senators , that is my best guess as to how we will proceed . 
i presume that we will sit past six o ' clock but i anticipate that we will not sit past seven o ' clock . 
it will , of course , be necessary for us to obtain leave . 
i notice that the whip is in agreement with my comments . 
i hope that we will have a quorum . 
senator kinsella : 
i would thank the honourable deputy leader of the government for his comments . 
it is helpful for all honourable senators to know how the afternoon will proceed . 
nisga ' a final agreement bill 
third reading - debate suspended 
honourable senators , in rising to begin the debate on third reading of bill c - 9 , to implement the nisga ' a final agreement , i wish to make my purposes on this occasion clear . 
i do not intend to repeat or review what i had to say in this chamber on december 16 last about the nisga ' a people and their long efforts to achieve a just solution to their claims and rights , nor do i intend to repeat or review my position with respect to all or most of the issues which i covered at that time . 
i hope that honourable senators will read my remarks of december 16 when they consider this proposed legislation . 
i wish to focus on only three main issues in this presentation . 
let me begin by mentioning the work of the committee and the context in british columbia which forms the background of this legislation . 
following second reading debate in the senate on bill c - 9 , the nisga ' a final agreement , which debate commenced on december 16 , 1999 , the bill was approved in principle and referred to the standing senate committee on aboriginal peoples . 
committee hearings began with the appearance of the honourable robert nault , minister of indian affairs and northern development , on february 16 . 
since that time , the committee has had before it some 30 witnesses in over 25 hours of meetings . 
i believe all members of the committee will agree that the committee ' s hearings gave full and fair opportunity to those who wished to speak to all sides of the relevant issues . 
i would commend honourable senators who served on the aboriginal peoples committee for their diligence and dedication to the study of bill c - 9 . 
the deputy chair of the committee , senator st. germain , who comes from british columbia , as i do , played a particularly active role and , while not neglecting any issue , gave special attention to the question of overlapping aboriginal claims . 
as chair of the aboriginal peoples committee , i extend my appreciation to all members for their support . 
i also wish to add a special thanks on behalf of the committee to senators grafstein , lawson , sparrow and tkachuk who , while not permanent members of the committee , attended and participated as if they were . 
their contribution is much appreciated . 
the enhancement of the nisga ' a identity , which is ensured by the establishment of new self - governing powers , the transfer of lands and resources , and the removal from the authoritarian provisions of the indian act , promises in future times a larger and more influential role in the public , social and economic affairs of the province for the aboriginal community as a whole . 
this is an uncomfortable development for some in british columbia , who , for deep conviction about political values or for economic reasons , see assimilation as the desirable or even necessary goal of public policy and are therefore hostile to the very concept of distinct aboriginal identity and the existence of a collective society within our greater society which is more individualistic in nature . 
the evidence of gordon gibson made these points clearly . 
for others in british columbia , the nisga ' a final agreement , while welcomed in a notional way , was mistrusted because it was the leading legislative priority of a highly unpopular provincial government whose hallmark in virtually all public issues can fairly be described as adversarial . 
the legislation became another hostage to the fortunes of the clark government . 
notwithstanding all this , when the nisga ' a final agreement was announced to the public by dr. joseph gosnell of the nisga ' a tribal council , by honourable jane stewart , the then indian affairs minister , and by then premier glen clark , the polls showed a majority of british columbians supported the agreement . 
as the fortunes of the clark government sank to an all - time low in public esteem , the polls showed a modest decline in support for the agreement . 
for the public at large , in spite of over 500 community consultations in british columbia and an open information process , in spite of the existence of the treaty negotiation advisory committee on which was represented every important business sector organization in the province , 35 member organizations in all , and in spite of the existence and involvement of advisory councils of citizens for wildlife , forestry , fisheries , mines , taxation , and self - government , and the role played by regional councils in the northwest part of british columbia where the nisga ' a reside , still some who are fundamentally opposed to change will continue to say that the public was not informed or consulted and had no chance to present their views . 
we have had some of this comment from certain witnesses . 
there remains , of course , a body of citizens who are well informed and who are genuinely concerned about the specific provisions contained in bill c - 9 and in the nisga ' a final agreement . 
their issues must be addressed fully , and the nature and purposes of the bill made as clear as human communication allows . 
in the course of the evidence , we heard questioning of , support for , and opposition to , a number of the key points in this proposed legislation . 
let me turn to those points . 
first is the question of the constitutional character of this bill . 
if it is believed to be a constitutional amendment , then the provisions for amending the constitution itself would apply if it were to be an agreement which would be constitutionally protected . 
that is not a step which i believe need be taken . 
under delegated power , the authority to change the nisga ' a final agreement would remain with parliament and the provincial legislature . 
under the nisga ' a final agreement , any change to its terms requires nisga ' a agreement as well . 
to change the agreement without nisga ' a approval would itself require a constitutional amendment . 
all the parties to the agreement accepted the nisga ' a position that , for their protection against the possibility of arbitrary future attitude , the agreement had to be made certain and not left open to question by sudden change in public pressure . 
other witnesses addressing the section 35 issue argued that no law has yet established whether the self - government provisions of the nisga ' a final agreement can be given constitutional protection under section 35 . 
those who said this question was in doubt , including a former justice of the supreme court of canada , the honourable willard estey , as well as mr. mel smith , a former constitutional advisor to the b.c. provincial government , argue that the issue is of such importance that bill c - 9 ought not to be passed by the senate but tabled with a request to the government of canada to direct a reference to the supreme court asking for an advisory opinion . 
the honourable robert nault , minister of indian affairs and northern development , in his second appearance before the committee on thursday , march 23 , defended the constitutionality of the nisga ' a final agreement and stated that , in the view of the government , all of its provisions would be constitutionally protected by section 35 , which was also necessary and desirable . 
he also said that the government had no intention of making a reference to the supreme court of canada . 
in my address to the senate on december 16 , 1999 , i gave close examination to the section 35 question and cited dean peter hogg and professor patrick monahan of osgoode law school , as well as professor brad morse of the university of ottawa law school , as supporting the constitutionality of bill c - 9 as well as the protection which section 35 will give to its provisions . 
before the committee , professors bruce ryder and kent mcneil of osgoode law school gave strong endorsement to these positions , as did professor doug sanders of the faculty of law of the university of british columbia . 
my view of the section 35 question , in short , is that the great preponderance of evidence from constitutional experts is that bill c - 9 , the nisga ' a final agreement , is valid , does not constitute an amendment to the constitution of canada , and that the rights created by bill c - 9 are to be constitutionally protected by the provisions of section 35 . 
my view expressed on december 16 last has been reinforced by the participation of the witnesses and by the contribution to the committee proceedings of senator beaudoin , senator andreychuk , and senator grafstein in particular . 
the second issue which received considerable attention is whether a third order of government is being created which in some way will affect the division of powers set out in sections 91 and 92 of the constitution act , 1867 and would therefore be unconstitutional in its very nature . 
the nisga ' a final agreement does provide to the nisga ' a certain legislative powers which are applicable to their own internal governance . 
these powers relate to matters such as education , culture , and social relationships among the nisga ' a . 
they are concurrent powers , in some respects , with federal and provincial powers , and the exercise of such powers must at all times meet federal and provincial standards . 
in questions such as who are recognized as nisga ' a and some similar matters , the laws to be made by the nisga ' a will prevail , but only if they are consistent with the charter of rights , which is the paramount law . 
paragraph 9 of the agreement ' s general provisions provides as follows : 
the canadian charter of rights and freedoms applies to nisga ' a government in respect of all matters within its authority , bearing in mind the free and democratic nature of nisga ' a government as set out in this agreement . 
this makes it clear that the charter will apply to the activities of nisga ' a government , including its law - making authority , and that the protection of the charter will be available to all persons affected by nisga ' a government decisions . 
with respect to the notion that all law - making authority must be found only in the constitution act , 1867 , professor sanders of the university of british columbia said in his evidence : 
the year 1982 , then , does represent , i think , something of a watershed , in that we come to terms in constitutional language with the fact of our colonial history and the continued existence of indian communities within the country that have not been assimilated and who are determined to continue as distinct communities within canada . 
once we constitutionalize those rights in 1982 , the older idea of a simple division of authority between two levels of government was gone . 
later he said : 
we also abandoned another fundamental principle in 1982 , which is the idea of parliamentary supremacy , that the constitution simply divided authority between two levels of government . 
the charter represented a major change in canadian constitutional life by creating limitations on the powers of both the federal and provincial governments , something totally different from the scheme of the constitution act , 1867 . 
professors ryder and mcneil made similar statements , as has senator beaudoin . 
the third key issue on which the committee spent much time is that of overlapping claims . 
while the nisga ' a had entered into boundary and use agreements with the tahltan and tsimshian nations , the nisga ' a final agreement proceeded in spite of the non - resolution of these issues with the gitxsan nation or the gitanyow nation . 
conflicting claims of entitlement were made by the nisga ' a , the gitxsan and the gitanyow . 
the committee was presented with maps , historical evidence , and an outline of the course of failed negotiations . 
elmer derrick and earl muldon , otherwise known as delgamuukw , were present for the gitxsan . 
glen williams made the major presentation for the gitanyow . 
we also heard from neil sterritt , a gitxsan , who had the role of negotiator at one time . 
as i said to these witnesses during the hearings , neither the committee nor the senate is a body to mediate , arbitrate or otherwise participate in dispute settlement . 
we may be of assistance if by the public presentation of claims and issues that prospect of settlement is moved forward . 
however , our task is to determine whether the proposed legislation before us has taken into account , in a fair and equitable way , the interests of the stakeholders and whether , on balance , the government of canada , the house of commons , and the legislature of the province of british columbia have made decisions - for it is the job of governments and legislators to decide - that can be justified as in the public interest . 
it has been longstanding policy in the government of canada , going back many years , that in negotiating modern treaties it is always preferable for aboriginal groups with overlapping traditional territories to reach agreement among themselves on the future use of those overlapping areas . 
minister nault , in his evidence on march 23 , said : 
let me be clear . 
the federal policy on overlaps recognizes that , in the face of unresolved impasses on overlap issues , the only solution may be to negotiate a treaty with each group in turn while respecting the rights of other affected aboriginal groups . 
it is important to note that , in the case of the nisga ' a final agreement , the nisga ' a and the gitanyow are both signatories to the 1991 northwest treaty accord that addresses common property . 
in addition , the nisga ' a have entered into bilateral overlap memorandums of understanding with both the tsimshian nation and the tahltan peoples . 
the nisga ' a final agreement contains an explicit statement $ that its provisions will not affect the aboriginal treaty rights of any other aboriginal group . 
honourable senators , the provisions of the nisga ' a final agreement make clear that the boundaries and uses for territory under the nisga ' a agreement can be changed either with their agreement as the result of negotiations with overlapping tribal nations - the gitsxan and the gitanyow and the question before us - or , alternatively , by litigation . 
if a court decides that the boundaries of nisga ' a lands have been wrongly agreed to and the evidence indicates that those lands are the entitlement of another nation , then the agreement , by its provisions , gives effect to that court decision . 
these are two methods by which the overlap issues can be settled . 
some object , saying that this may require long and costly litigation . 
it is our system that if parties cannot agree , the courts will settle the issue . 
they are our recourse to peaceful dispute settlement . 
the committee , as honourable senators are aware , decided to append an observation to the fourth report . 
in our observation we said that although we are aware and understand the equity which exists in the agreement to provide for a settlement of overlap claims , we are nonetheless concerned and urge the government and the parties to negotiate expeditiously and continuously in the prospect of the settlement of those claims . 
as a committee , we believe that the government of canada , in particular , should give the highest priority to the negotiations and to systems of settlement that can include mediation or , perhaps , arbitration , if the parties in question are prepared to proceed in that way . 
honourable senators , there are many other issues that came before the committee in the evidence that we heard , such as questions relating to fishing rights , which are of interest to senator comeau . 
there were questions with respect to the definition of " citizenship " and the political right of non - nisga ' a minorities , which are of particular interest to senator grafstein . 
there was the question of the nature of nisga ' a self - government in the operating sense ; as well as the use and entitlement to individual properties by nisga ' a members . 
i will not attempt to deal today with these questions , and others . 
i do not believe they are in any way an impediment to this particular legislation . 
however , there is information , and i believe it is satisfactory , for honourable senators should they wish to have it . 
we are the last legislative step in this process . 
as such , we have a particular responsibility for care . 
we have a particular responsibility , in my submission , to the nisga ' a people to treat their agreement with the government of canada and the province of british columbia with the utmost seriousness , with support and with our endorsement . 
honourable senators , those are the remarks i wish to make at the moment . 
i look forward to the opportunity to conclude this debate over the course of the next few days . 
hon. gerry st. germain : 
honourable senators , i should like to ask a question of the honourable senator austin . 
as senator austin has informed the senate in his speech , the major concern that i have is with the overlap situation , which i will deal with when i address the senate on this important piece of legislation . 
there is no question that to british columbians this is the beginning of negotiations with a huge number of native bands within our province as we seek certainty from economic and other perspectives , in the main trying to improve the plight of our aboriginal peoples in the province of british columbia . 
i informed the honourable senator austin of the question i am about to ask . 
i did that because it is only fair . 
this is not a matter of trickery or opposition ; it is a matter of finding a resolution and a level of satisfaction for all the peoples of british columbia in regard to what the government is doing to them in this particular instance . 
in many cases , governments do things to people instead of for people . 
the greatest concern of rank and file non - natives is the question of accountability . 
they want to make certain that all natives in these particular bands will benefit . 
many good people are victimized under such circumstances . 
what we will be doing in this particular case is , by virtue of non - delegation , constitutionalizing this proposed legislation and this agreement . 
mr. jim aldridge , who is well informed on this , has used the expression that this is no different from a municipality . 
when i asked them how they would sustain economic viability , the answer was that there would be transfer payments from the government to the bands . 
if , for some odd reason , in the future - and it does not matter whether the nisga ' a enter into other agreements - we enter into an agreement that is constitutionalized , as this one will be , will we be allowed to withhold funding ? 
what other method of checks and balances is available ? 
however , if we are to accept the statement that it will be similar to a municipality , we all know that if , for any reason , a municipality goes astray in its administration , the province can withhold funding . 
i have given senator austin notice of this question so that , hopefully , he will be able to provide an answer . 
where are the checks and balances ? 
where will the comfort be for those people all across the country who are concerned about this , but especially british columbians since it is so close to home ? 
senator austin : 
the honourable senator has used the word " accountability " in different senses in his short question . 
i feel compelled to separate the question into its constituent parts . 
i believe that the nisga ' a constitution and the agreement provides a sound and proper system for accounting . 
the nisga ' a government will be obliged to account to the government of the province of british columbia for the funds it contributes , and to the government of canada for the funds it contributes . 
it will be obliged to account to the nisga ' a people in an open and accountable way for the manner in which it conducts its government in the financial and accounting sense . 
senator st. germain also used the word " accounting " in the sense of equitable distribution of the benefits , which adds a more political tone to the definition of " accountability " . 
" political accountability " , perhaps , would be what he meant . 
the nisga ' a government will be a popularly and democratically elected government . 
it will pursue policies in the same way that any government pursues policies ; that is , with its mind on its voters . 
i would make the assumption that that government will take into account all of its voters in deciding what programs to follow , how to spend money , where to invest in the well - being of the nisga ' a community . 
that is a matter of fundamental democracy which is an obligation of the nisga ' a lisims government . 
the word " accountable " to the non - nisga ' a stakeholders is , again , a question of political accountability . 
the nisga ' a government is not a government that will conduct the affairs of the nisga ' a community in the absence of the observation of its neighbours . 
the nisga ' a government will be a part of the regional council of kitimat and the northwest area . 
it will have relations with its aboriginal and non - aboriginal neighbours in fields like health care , regional development , highway construction , communication , and all the other facets which are relevant to a community living within a much larger community . 
i also believe that the nisga ' a lisims government will be aware of the eyes of british columbia and canada viewing this as a major change in relations between the aboriginal community and the general community . 
the public at large will be watching to see how successful this agreement will be in its implementation and in its effect . 
in that way , i believe , politically , that the nisga ' a lisims government will understand clearly that it has a political accountability , not only to its members but also to the people of british columbia , to its neighbours in their part of the province , and to the aboriginal community as a whole . 
that is my answer to the honourable senator ' s question . 
senator st. germain : 
honourable senators , all of us have come to know the people who are in responsible positions at this time . 
the question relates not to when things are operating properly , which the honourable senator refers to , but to when there is a breakdown of the financial accountability . 
does the province and the federal government have the right to withhold funding ? 
my question is not about political accountability , it is about financial accountability . 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , because the question deserves an absolutely accurate answer , i will look at those agreements and draw the attention of senator st. germain to the appropriate clauses therein . 
i will do that before the conclusion of this debate . 
senator st. germain : 
thank you . 
hon. g é rald - a . 
the honourable senator has given a good report on this question but committee members were still divided on it . 
it is true that some experts , not all , came to the conclusion that it was perfectly constitutional . 
notwithstanding that , however , i believe that some senators , on both sides of the committee who were still not convinced . 
i think there is a serious doubt about the constitutionality of certain articles that give paramountcy . 
having said that , i have no hesitation in speaking in favour of the accord . 
what should we do at this stage ? 
is it our intention to go forward acknowledging that , if this question of constitutionality is put before the courts , we will comply with the decisions of the courts ? 
would it not be better - as the governor in council has a right to do - to raise that question in the courts before passing the bill and giving it royal assent ? 
perhaps this question is already before the courts . 
the fact is that , since the doubt is serious , i believe the question should be resolved . 
i have no problem with the remainder of the bill . 
however , there is still some doubt in my mind about the question i raised . 
do i understand correctly that the doubt will be ignored ? 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , i know that this issue has been raised by the honourable senator in committee . 
i am satisfied that those powers which are accorded to the nisga ' a lisims government in bill c - 9 are within the constitutional power of canada and the province of british columbia to provide . 
in the delgamuukw case , it was implicit within the court ' s definition of aboriginal title that there be a right of collective governance . 
that is a right of self - government with respect to the use and allocation of lands and to the governance of the affairs of the collective entity . 
with that implicit comment , i believe there is a constitutional foundation for this particular provision . 
i do not have a case directly on point , nor has senator beaudoin . 
hon. lowell murray : 
but he wants to create one . 
senator austin : 
we are arguing by implication . 
legislation changes the meaning of laws , and decisionsmust be taken . 
the parties to this agreement see it very much in the interests of them all to provide the nisga ' alisims government with the capacity to govern those narrow affairs - i think there are 14 items in all - that federal and provincial law would not override in the area of self - government affecting education and culture . 
senator beaudoin : 
for the purpose of the record , i wish to say that so far the supreme court has never said that there is such a thing as a third order of government . 
they may say that in the future , but they have not done so yet . 
in my opinion , we are divided on this issue . 
however , it has not been said . 
i have read the cases mentioned , and nowhere does it state that there is such a thing as a third order of government under section 35 . 
we have a serious doubt . 
in the end , only the courts can settle this matter . 
i understand that this is what will happen . 
senator austin : 
i should like to respond to your observation , senator beaudoin , by making it clear that the evidence before us from all of those constitutional authorities who spoke in favour of bill c - 9 was that the delgamuukw case established that self - government would fall within the definition of section 35 . 
however , the court said that it cannot decide the issue on the basis of broad claims . 
it urged the parties to negotiate the issues that are involved in self - government and asked that agreements be concluded . 
the court cannot address the broad claim , but it can address the specific powers that have been created under the concept of self - government for the aboriginal communities . 
i agree with my honourable friend . 
we are responding to directions of the court . 
however , there is no full , final determination by the court of how broad the powers of the government are under section 35 . 
the duty of legislators is to legislate . 
if the court has another view on this issue , we will certainly hear about it , as the honourable senator says , and will have to accommodate it . 
hon. david tkachuk : 
honourable senators , i wish to follow up on the previous question . 
section 35 and the question of self - government bothered many of us throughout the entire hearings of our committee . 
we heard the professors of law from osgoode hall talk about this new theory of constitutional law to which the government obviously subscribes now . 
when i asked mr. molloy why the rules outlining self - government were put into the treaty so that it would fall into section 35 rather than being delegated , he said it was because they insisted on it . 
obviously , the government has said that it will go in that direction . 
the concurrent power was not addressed satisfactorily by the government witnesses nor by the osgoode hall group that has this interesting theory of constitutional law . 
if concurrent powers are now recognized by the liberal government as being in what i call this new third order of government on education , on culture , and so on , these powers are quite wide - ranging . 
they are drawn from 1867 and previous years , which is the reason for these powers being concurrent . 
does the government of canada subscribe to the fact that the concept of concurrent powers for defence , communications and other areas - areas that people would find totally unbelievable , but that is the logical conclusion - is the direction in which we are going ? 
can concurrent powers for almost all areas of government fly from section 91 and section 92 and be placed in future treaties and then " constitutionlized " under section 35 ? 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , i recognize the senator tkachuk ' s question because he pursued it with experts during the course of committee hearings . 
i should like to answer the honourable senator in the following way . 
section 35 is a part of the constitution of canada . 
by bringing section 35 into being , the federal government and the provinces agreed to a limitation on their powers under the 1867 constitution in which all powers were assigned to either the federal government or the provincial governments under sections 91 and 92 . 
section 35 says that under our constitution aboriginal rights must be included and taken into account in the exercise of future legislative authority by the federal government and the provinces . 
these rights were protected , first , by the royal proclamation of 1763 , and then all existing rights were protected in 1982 . 
a provision of the constitution made it clear that broader rights , not simply historical rights , could be created by those governments , federal and provincial , and that those rights , when created , would be protected by section 35 . 
there is a " living tree " doctrine here , not only in the processes of legislation but also in the judicial opinion of the supreme court of canada . 
at another time , possibly in my concluding remarks , i could refer to some of those supreme court of canada cases . 
finally , in response to the honourable senator ' s observation , i suppose that if a federal and provincial government agreed to broader powers than those that exist in the nisga ' a final agreement , those broader powers would be part of that encroaching aboriginal right . 
remember , however , that the precondition is agreement by a federal and provincial government . 
there will be future negotiations with aboriginal communities . 
there will be differences in the shape and nature of the legislation that is brought before us in terms of what rights any particular aboriginal community would like to exercise . 
however , we will see nothing unless the government of canada and the government of a province agrees to it and legislates it in the specific provincial legislature and in the house of commons . 
i do not think a worst - case worry that future politicians may do something that is in derogation of the future public interest is a fair basis for establishing the concern at this time with respect to this legislation . 
senator tkachuk : 
the worst - case worry that i have about future politicians is perfectly symbolized in the bill . 
i was at those meetings in 1982 and 1983 . 
i think former prime minister pierre elliott trudeau would be very surprised at what is happening in this bill . 
i do not think the right of self - government is what was intended . 
i remember that those rights were placed in the charlottetown accord . 
up to the time that the charlottetown accord was written , governments assumed that those rights were not there . 
they must have , otherwise , why would they have included those rights in the charlottetown accord ? 
i am worried about the future because i know what the present has done with the past . 
that is my concern . 
if i am correct , the wording of the nisga ' a bill is very close to the charlottetown accord . 
the canadian people and every indian reserve in canada rejected it . 
first , i do not follow the logic of the argument of 1982 - 83 , that this is what was meant , the treaty grew , then it stopped and then we had the charlottetown accord . 
the people rejected it , it grew again and now it comes back to us based on something that happened in 1982 and was rejected in the charlottetown accord . 
that is my concern . 
i am worried about what future politicians will do on the basis of this particular agreement . 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , i should put on the record my observation with respect to senator tkachuk ' s comments . 
bill c - 9 is within the parameters of paragraph 45 of the charlottetown accord . 
the premiers and the government of canada sought to provide specific drafted legislation giving self - government to aboriginal communities under certain circumstances . 
that accord failed , famously , for whatever reason . 
historians will debate that for some time . 
i do not think the reason for its failure can be attributed toparagraph 45 in any reasonable or logical way . 
i was not a part of the discussions creating the charlottetown accord or the agreement between the federal and provincial governments . 
with respect to the charlottetown accord , senator murray was there and , perhaps , could give us the best evidence of the intention at the time . 
i was told that it was " for greater certainty . " 
i was in the cabinet of former prime minister trudeau from 1980 - 81 . 
i spent six months on the joint senate and house constitutional committee which , as i said before , was co - chaired by now senator serge joyal . 
i understood that paragraph 45 would create a foundation for the aboriginal community in order that their position in canadian society would be more constitutionally protected . 
i have spoken to former prime minister trudeau within the last few months about bill c - 9 and he is delighted with it . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
honourable senators , senator austin ' s speaking time has expired . 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , i seek leave to extend my time in order to answer any remaining questions . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
is leave granted , honourable senators ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
hon. herbert o . sparrow : 
can the senator elaborate on those polls , when they were taken and what the results were ? 
the polls that have crossed my desk would not support the statement that the senator has made . 
i then have another question . 
does the honourable senator want me to ask all my questions now ? 
senator austin : 
i may not do justice to the honourable senator ' s second question if i do not answer the first one . 
perhaps i could say that i do not have the polls at hand , but i will get them . 
when the agreement was announced by the two governments and the nisga ' a tribal council , there was a positive poll . 
my recollection is that roughly 54 or 55 per cent of respondents were in favour of the agreement . 
by the time the british columbia legislature finished the debate , popular opinion had declined by about 8 or 9 per cent . 
i will look for those polls . 
senator sparrow : 
there is a difference between the time the initial proposal was made and the final agreement was made . 
the people would have had an opportunity to look more closely at the final agreement . 
that would be helpful . 
the senator also stated that there was a great predominance of evidence that this was not a constitutional change . 
i think that is what he said in his remarks . 
senator austin : 
no , i did not say that . 
i said there was a great predominance of evidence from constitutional experts who appeared before the committee that bill c - 9 was constitutional and that government provisions would be protected by section 35 of the constitution act , 1982 . 
senator sparrow : 
can senator austin provide a list indicating which witnesses were invited to appear and were accepted and those witnesses who applied to appear before the committee ? 
senator austin : 
i do not understand the question . 
senator sparrow : 
the steering committee invited certain people to appear without prompting from individuals . 
there were people who asked to appear before the committee . 
i should like to have a list of those witnesses . 
my reason for asking is that it is easy to obtain a predominance of witnesses to favour a certain belief , if that is what one wants , in a particular case . 
i am aware that some witnesses were refused invitations to appear before the committee , for whatever reason . 
there might very well be a difference in the preponderance of the witnesses who have appeared because of the invitations that were extended . 
senator austin : 
the honourable senator is entitled to his opinion . 
my view - and i think it is the view of all members of the committee - is that we heard relevant witnesses on all the issues . 
there were perhaps four or five witnesses who sought to come , and it was the view of the steering committee that their evidence would not likely address directly the issues in bill c - 9 or that they simply would repeat the evidence that other witnesses had already given . 
i can tell honourable senators , for example , that kerry - lynne findlay , q . c . , who represents the musqueam leaseholders in vancouver - 
senator st. germain : 
she lives there . 
senator austin : - sought to appear . 
i had a discussion with her . 
she wanted to give evidence quite similar to that which she gave when bill c - 49 was before the senate . 
it was essentially to argue that an aboriginal government could be very arbitrary about the way in which it used its powers . 
that evidence is on the senate record under bill c - 49 . 
i discussed the matter with her and she agreed not to appear . 
there are others . 
if my honourable friend has names , i would gladly tell him the reason for the decision we took not to invite other witnesses . 
senator sparrow : 
honourable senators , i should like clarification from the honourable senator austin . 
i asked him for information about those people who were invited to attend the committee hearings by invitation and those who had applied directly to appear . 
can he do that ? 
senator austin : 
i will ask the clerk of the committee to give my honourable friend three lists : those whose appearance the committee initiated ; those who were invited because they expressed interest in appearing ; and those who , in the latter category and in the former category , were either not willing to appear or were not invited to appear . 
hon. no ë l a . kinsella ( deputy leader of the opposition ) : 
honourable senators , first and foremost , i wish to congratulate all members of the committee for the assiduous and thoughtful work they did on that committee with a very complex and difficult piece of legislation , resting as it does on a very complicated and , in many ways , pioneering treaty . 
to senator austin and his colleagues , i express the appreciation of the whole house that the committee was able to do that kind of detailed work . 
however , i have a couple of questions for the honourable senator austin . 
first , what is the view of his committee as to the repealability of bill c - 9 , should it become a statute of the statutes of canada ? 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , as i said in my address , bill c - 9 is protected by the provisions of section 35 . 
could he clarify that for me ? 
senator kinsella : 
should the bill presently before us be adopted by parliament and therefore become a statute , can that statute be repealed ? 
senator austin : 
the one constitutional method that exists for removingbill c - 9 from law is a constitutional amendment under the provisions of the constitution act . 
that would have to be done by the federal parliament and the legislatures of seven provinces representing more than 50 per cent of the population . 
senator kinsella : 
honourable senators , if we are dealing with a unique legislative proposal that speaks to the virtual annihilation of that part of the principle of parliamentary supremacy that remains since the constitution act of 1982 , does it not stand mutatis mutandis that we must be absolutely certain - that is to say , we must have a higher degree of certainty - that the legislation we adopt in this house would be constitutionally pure , if not constitutionally as secure as is humanly possible ? 
i have not read all of the presentations submitted by the witnesses and then examined by the honourable members of the committee , but i did read the written submission of former justice estey . 
in fact , i read it three or four times . 
what i read the former justice saying was that this bill , should it become law , would be unconstitutional . 
that shook me . 
i am quite concerned because now senator austin has just told us that this bill would be non - repealable . 
did the honourable senator ' s committee examine that question ? 
if so , how has he come down on the principle of the degree of certitude or the degree of perfection that this house must satisfy itself has been achieved when we are to pass a piece of legislation that , to use his words , will make the repeal of this law only possible through a constitutional amendment ? 
senator austin : 
i thank the honourable senator for that question . 
under the provisions of the bill and the nisga ' a final agreement , any part of it that is found to be unconstitutional will be set aside but the rest of the agreement will stand . 
i do agree with senator kinsella that this is an important step in constitutional law and practice in canada and that it is our job in the senate to be careful to understand what it is we are legislating . 
we must satisfy ourselves , not perfectly and finally , because that degree of perfection cannot be attained at any time in any place , but , on the balance or even on a preponderance of the evidence that this bill is constitutional . 
certainly , i am satisfied on a preponderance of the evidence of the osgoode hall " gang " - to use a word that was used earlier - and other evidence that it is constitutional . 
however , i should like to add that in the sparrow decision the court reserved unto itself a " living tree " doctrine with respect to the entrenchment of aboriginal rights . 
i know that my honourable friend is fully aware of that provision . 
aboriginal rights will be considered from time to time within the ambit of the times . 
thus , there is no absolute aboriginal right ; it is a relative right . 
with those protections , i believe that we are in good shape with this legislation . 
senator kinsella : 
i thank the honourable senator for that . 
like the honourable senator , i was privileged to participate as an advisor to the government of new brunswick during the constitutional discussions of the late 1970 s and early 1980 s . 
i have a photograph in my office of senator austin and other senators who were involved at that time . 
i accept the doctrine of the living tree - the doctrine of growth and openness to principles that were not defined in an essential way by section 35 of the constitution act , 1982 . 
in dealing with aboriginal self - government and being desirous of finding the flesh and bones to make this more meaningful in the early part of the 21 st century , did the committee consider that , as opposed to constitutional amendment , it would be more prudent not to seal the box but rather to use techniques such as delegation to allow fine tuning and improvement through a more accessible approach within parliament ? 
senator austin : 
we heard evidence and discussed the questions of delegated power and constitutional protection . 
we looked at the nub of the agreement on this issue , that being the insecurity that any party in the position of the nisga ' a would feel given the history of treatment by legislatures of their community and other aboriginal communities over the last 100 years . 
earlier , i mentioned the deprivation of the aboriginal community in british columbia of even the most fundamental right of access to the courts . 
in this case , much was negotiated and much was traded at many levels to reach this complicated agreement . 
it was found desirable by the federal and provincial governments to give the nisga ' a the protection of certainty with respect to this agreement - certainty , with the reservations i have already mentioned regarding the way in which the agreement can be changed , amended or renegotiated . 
i endorse that provision very strongly . 
i have no hang - up with respect to the division of powers between sections 91 and 92 . 
we took that decision in 1982 . 
some want to repeal section 35 . 
they want to argue from propositions that start without acknowledging its existence . 
with respect to the final point senator kinsella made with regard to former justice estey , his argument was that we do not know , that the bill is momentous and that we should send it to the court . 
however , as was pointed out in the evidence , parliament is the highest court in canada and it is our job to decide . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
what about the supreme court ? 
senator austin : 
parliament is the highest court in canada , in spite of senator lynch - staunton ' s view . 
i believe that we will act in the public interest by passing this legislation . 
if there is a constitutional provision to be set aside , which i do not believe will happen , we have a process for that . 
senator murray : 
may i pursue this line of questioning after royal assent ? 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
honourable senators , it is now five o ' clock and royal assent is scheduled to occur at this time . 
the speaker will be back in the chair after royal assent , and he will decide whether there will be more questions . 
senator kinsella : 
what do you mean " he will decide " ? 
the senate will decide . 
hon. dan hays ( deputy leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , we have agreed to suspend the sitting for royal assent at five o ' clock . 
this is a fascinating and extraordinary exchange . 
i do not believe that any other senator on the other side intends to speak today . 
am i correct ? 
senator lynch - staunton : 
we have questions for senator austin . 
senator hays : 
in an attempt to accommodate the business of the chamber , i suggest that we adjourn this matter as it stands and that when this order is next called we continue this productive and important exchange . 
we were hoping to reach a few other items on the order paper , and this arrangement would accommodate that as well as royal assent . 
senator kinsella : 
as all honourable senators know , the opposition is always accommodating , understanding and generous beyond words . 
senator austin has been forthcoming in helping us to understand the evidence heard by he and his colleagues on this very important matter . 
i have not read all the testimony that our colleagues on the committee heard . 
many issues arise to which only the chairman of the committee can respond . 
he has presented the report and has spoken to it , and we have many questions to ask . 
if the deputy leader of the government is proposing that rather than continue this discussion after royal assent we resume debate on bill c - 9 on tuesday , we would be agreeable to that . 
senator hays : 
thank you . 
therefore , when this item is next called on the orders of the day , we will continue with questions to the first speaker at third reading . 
is that agreeable , senator austin ? 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , my first obligation is to sponsor this bill . 
i will be back in my chair on tuesday . 
if colleagues send me their questions in the interim , i would be able to expedite the answers . 
i do not claim all knowledge on this complicated legislation . 
i am doing my best as an amateur to explain it . 
senator hays : 
as senator austin does not object to our agreement , if all other senators agree , i propose that we suspend the sitting and proceed thereafter with order no. 2 under government business . 
[ later ] 
the hon. the speaker : 
senator hays : 
honourable senators , when bill c - 9 is called on the order paper at the next sitting of the senate , we have agreed to return to the stage we were at when the sitting of the senate was suspended . 
senator austin has graciously agreed to be here at that time to continue dealing with questions of honourable senators . 
the hon. the speaker : 
honourable senators , is it agreed ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
debate suspended . 
the senate adjourned during pleasure . 
royal assent 
i have the honour to inform you that her excellency the governor general has been pleased to cause letters patent to be issued under her sign manual and signet constituting the honourable ian binnie , puisne judge of the supreme court of canada , her deputy , to do in her excellency ' s name all acts on her part necessary to be done during her excellency ' s pleasure . 
the said commission was read by the clerk of the senate . 
the honourable the deputy governor general was pleased to give the royal assent to the following bills : 
an act to amend the criminal records act and to amend another act in consequence ( bill c - 7 , chapter 1 , 2000 ) 
an act to amend the criminal code ( flight ) ( bill c - 202 , chapter 2 , 2000 ) 
an act to amend the act of incorporation of the board of elders of the canadian district of the moravian church in america ( bill s - 14 ) 
the honourable peter milliken , deputy speaker of the house of commons , then addressed the honourable the deputy governor general as follows : 
may it please your honour : 
the commons of canada have voted certain supplies required to enable the government to defray the expenses of the public service . 
in the name of the commons , i present to your honour the following bills : 
an act for granting to her majesty certain sums of money for the public service of canada for the financial year ending march 31 , 2000 ( bill c - 29 , chapter 3 , 2000 ) 
an act for granting to her majesty certain sums of money for the public service of canada for the financial year ending march 31 , 2001 ( bill c - 30 , chapter 4 , 2000 ) 
to which bill i humbly request your honour ' s assent . 
the honourable the deputy governor general was pleased to give the royal assent to the said bills . 
the house of commons withdrew . 
the honourable the deputy governor general was pleased to retire . 
the sitting of the senate was resumed . 
visitors in the gallery 
the hon. the speaker : 
honourable senators , before we proceed to other business , i should like to call to your attention some special guests in our gallery . 
we have a number of members of the other place , notably mr. dan mcteague , who is the sponsor of a special bill that we passed today . 
mr. mcteague has with him some guests who have a particular interest in the bill . 
they are mr. cid bowman and ms karen kalvereda , the father and sister of a police officer from the toronto region who was killed while in public service . 
accompanying mr. mcteague are other members of the house of commons . 
they are albina guarnieri , joe jordan , and some others . 
we also welcome raymond bonin , the member of parliament from sudbury , and senator marie - p . 
poulin , representing the region of sudbury . 
today , they invited members of the family of the police officer killed in the line of duty . 
as well , we have a group of police officers from the association polici è re de la r é gion de sudbury who have come all the way from sudbury for this special occasion . 
hon. senators : 
hear , hear ! 
the hon. the speaker : 
on behalf of all honourable senators , i wish you welcome here in the senate of canada for this important event . 
bill to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the supreme court of canada in the quebec secession reference 
second reading - debate continued 
on the order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the honourable senator boudreau , p . c . , seconded by the honourable senator hays , for the second reading of bill c - 20 , to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the supreme court of canada in the quebec secession reference . 
hon. joan fraser : 
honourable senators , i had not intended to speak on bill c - 20 until later in the process , and it is still my intention to do so . 
however , it occurs to me that there are a few remarks that may be worth making now . 
we are lawmakers and we may never , in the senate , have to consider more important legislation . 
it seems to me that before even considering the legal aspect of the bill , we have to recognize that this is a deeply political issue , in the noblest meaning of the term . 
it is this aspect that i want to discuss today . 
yesterday , the leader of the opposition appropriately reminded us that quebec is not the only province that has experienced secessionist movements . 
nova scotia experienced some and , more recently , such movements have also emerged in western canada . 
honourable senators , in the spring of 1968 , on april 20 to be precise , i was a young journalist attending the first convention of the sovereignty association movement , which would later become the parti qu é b é cois . 
this was a turning point in our history . 
honourable senators , think about what was going on in the world in 1968 . 
that spring there were riots across the western world . 
paris was the scene of an uprising that would topple a giant , charles de gaulle . 
in the united states , cities were burning , inspiring leaders were being assassinated , a president was being rejected , and his party could choose a successor only behind armed guards , while outside in the streets the youth of the nation battled the police . 
around the world , from ireland to vietnam , violence seemed to be the preferred way , sometimes the only way , to settle social or communal differences . 
while the world raged , what were we in canada doing ? 
we were choosing the peaceful way , the way of democracy , of politics . 
i believed then , and i still believe passionately , that preserving the unity of canada is a great cause worth dedicating one ' s life to . 
i believe with equal passion that it has to be done democratically , politically . 
i sometimes think that separatists do not realize what a huge compliment they paid canada the day they decided to conduct their battle along strictly democratic lines . 
canada allowed a secessionist party to be created and elected and to form a government in its province , and let it hold a referendum on secession in accordance with provincial laws without federal interference or control . 
canada allowed this series of events to take place not once , but twice , and canada is prepared to do so a third time if that is what quebecers want . 
honourable senators , find me another great country that would do as much . 
it would not be the united states , where they fought a bloody civil war to prevent secession . 
it would not be france , whose constitution states flatly that france is one and indivisible . 
it would not be the vast majority of countries on the face of the earth . 
a country exists because its people want it to exist - that is its only moral basis for being . 
i take it as a point of immense national pride that , collectively , we have accepted that fundamental principle . 
of course , if it comes down to it , the departure must be done lawfully . 
however , if it comes to that , the first job of legislators on both sides will be to ascertain the true public will , the true public conviction , and then to respect it . 
this imposes some disciplines on politicians on both sides . 
the first of these , i suggest , is the obligation on both sides to be clear as the voters prepare to make their momentous decision . 
the supreme court ' s decision makes it plain that the secessionist side has an obligation of clarity : an obligation to put a clear question and to get a clear majority in response . 
these are not academic points , honourable senators . 
we know that there has been a substantial lack of clarity in the minds of a significant proportion of the people of quebec at times in the past when they have been called upon to make this momentous decision . 
it is our duty as canadians , and as quebecers , to fight to achieve clarity . 
since democracy depends on fully informed voters , that means , as i say , that both sides must be clear . 
in essence , politically , bill c - 20 is a recognition of that obligation on the federal side - the obligation we have to canadian citizens , and particularly to those who live in the province considering secession . 
this bill is the most formal statement possible of the way the federal side will conduct itself , should we ever again face a referendum on secession . 
it adheres scrupulously to the democratic process . 
it does not prevent the secessionist side from asking whatever question it wants . 
the questions that have been asked in the past could be asked in the future . 
this bill does not set out any rules for the conduct of any referendum in quebec or anywhere else . 
it does , however , set out the process by which the federal side would determine whether it should , indeed , enter negotiations about the terms of secession , or whether it should decide that the will of the people to secede was not sufficiently clear to justify entering negotiations - another momentous decision , but one surely requiring a maximum of clarity . 
honourable senators , this bill establishes that process now , ahead of time , so that the voters , if the time comes , may be fully informed . 
surely this is better . 
surely acting now is better than waiting until the last moment - until a referendum is again upon us and our action might be or be seen to be influenced by panic . 
this is not , of course , the only way the federal side could have addressed its obligation to be clear . 
i think we are all familiar with the various suggestions that have been made for alternative approaches , and we could all probably envisage more ourselves if we set our minds to it . 
this , however , is a completely legitimate approach . 
the prime minister has listened to advice from many quarters and , on the strength of that long experience , he believes that this is the best rule to follow . 
i believe that decision merits the greatest respect . 
bill c - 20 does not , of course , absolve the federal government of its fundamental continuing responsibility to provide government that serves the interests and concerns of all canadians , including those living in provinces with secessionist movements . 
indeed , the best way to fight secession , surely , is to speak and act in such a way that canadians continue to know that they live in what truly is - and any of us who have travelled know that it is - the best country in the world . 
nor does this bill absolve the federal government or , indeed , all federalists , including those who sit in this chamber , from campaigning vigorously for canada whenever that is needed . 
bill c - 20 , however , addresses the obligation to be clear about how we shall act if we ever again do get to that painful point of imminent possible secession . 
that clarity is surely in the interest of all canadians . 
honourable senators , i should like to say a little about one other topic that has caused many of us to reflect carefully , and that is the role of the senate in the process established bybill c - 20 . here again , there have been and will be rigorous legal arguments . 
the leader of the government in the senate led the way last week , and others will continue that process . 
once again , i would like to think for a moment about the underlying political quality of the issue . 
i should like to say , as a senator and as an english quebecer , i take very seriously the senate ' s responsibility to represent regions and minorities in canada . 
i believe the way the fathers of confederation established the senate ' s representation in quebec makes it very plain that that role was , if anything , intended to be even stronger in the case of quebec than in the other provinces . 
as a member of a community that would be gravely affected if quebec seceded , i cannot ignore that responsibility . 
honourable senators , i think also of the nature of our democracy , of the nature of the parliamentary system that has served canadians so well and continues to do so . 
the senate has powers that in almost all cases are equal to the powers of the other place . 
we take those powers seriously , and we attempt to exercise them in the best interests of canada . 
even where our power is clear , and the subject at issue is vital , we tend to act along the lines of what is known as the salisbury doctrine , because it was first enunciated by the fifth marquess of salisbury , who said that it be would be constitutionally wrong for the upper house to oppose proposals which had been put before the electorate and approved by the electorate . 
we do not block the clearly expressed popular will , even in matters where , in law , we have the power to do so . 
then there is the class of matters where we did not have that power - a class that is so fundamentally political that it is the exclusive prerogative of the house of commons , the chamber of the people ' s elected representatives . 
i find myself , however , powerfully affected by the argument that the focus of bill c - 20 , the government ' s approach to the possible secession of a province of canada , is another such subject , something that is so fundamentally , inherently political , so directly and intimately bound up with the will of the people , that it , too , falls into that small but crucial class where it is the house of commons and not parliament as a whole that must take the decision and , of course , bear the responsibility for doing so . 
this does not mean that the senate has no role . 
in this case , perhaps more than in any other , we would bear a heavy responsibility to exercise the rights that , although in a different context , were summed up in a famous phrase : 
we have the right to be consulted , to encourage and to warn . bill 
c - 20 does allow for the exercise of that right . 
we may wish - i expect we all wish - that the bill had been drafted more explicitly on this aspect , but the recognition is there . 
if we choose to express our view on the clarity of either the referendum question or the referendum result , the house of commons must take our view into account . 
senator fraser : 
i think that we may take it for granted that the senate , starting perhaps with the leader of the opposition , would indeed express its view with all possible vigour . 
if we did not , we would be failing in our duty , and i know we would not fail in our duty . 
we do have a perspective that is different from the perspective of the other place , and it would be important for us to speak clearly and loudly . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
the honourable senator ' s speaking time has expired . 
is leave granted that she may continue ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
please proceed , senator fraser . 
senator fraser : 
honourable senators , i am seriously impressed by the argument that the ultimate decision is the prerogative of the other place . 
many have legal expertise , which i will never have . 
almost all of you have more experience in the senate . 
the reason i dared to share some of my thoughts today is that , in my own way , i have been involved in the national question for over 30 years . 
i have given it much thought . 
i have learned lessons that were sometimes hard . 
my democratic principles have guided me during all this time . 
they are at least as relevant today as they were in the past . 
hon. no ë l a . kinsella ( deputy leader of the opposition ) : 
would the honourable senator take a question ? 
senator fraser : 
yes. 
senator kinsella : 
with reference to the honourable senator ' s remarks concerning the current non - determinative role of the senate of canada , has she in her reflections on this matter considered some of the ways in which the bill could be amended to very easily accommodate both the desire of the prime minister not to have this process held up in terms of time , and , second , to meet the very serious obligations before us in this house ? 
in fact , i suggest there is the historic obligation to secure the consent of this house as a part of the consent of parliament . 
for example , has the honourable senator considered simply moving an amendment to the bill whereby it would be for the house of commons and the senate to determine the clarity of the question or the clarity of the majority , and specify that it be done through a joint committee of the house of commons and the senate ? 
senator fraser : 
honourable senators , i have considered that . 
like most senators , my emotional preference would be for us to be involved as closely as possible . 
we have no guarantee that , if it came to that , we would have a solid government of any party in the house of commons . 
indeed , one may suspect that it would be at a time when the house of commons was in some disarray that the government of a secessionist province might see its moment to move . 
i am not sure that it would be practically desirable to build in such a shift . 
senator kinsella : 
based on that answer , has the honourable senator given thought to another model which would also address the concerns that she just raised , that is to say , that each house shall make a determination within six sitting days of the commencement of the process ? 
senator fraser : 
we are perfectly free to make a determination as quickly as we wish , should it come to that - and we all devoutly hope it will not . 
i repeat that i find myself stumbling each time over the notion that , if our consent is required and if our voice must give assent to whatever it is that the house of commons is doing , that does give us a blocking role . 
i am powerfully impressed by the argument that this , in the end , is a decision that must be taken by the other place . 
we would have to speak clearly about what we thought they were about to do . 
if we disagreed with what they were to do , then it would be our duty to go to the people and try to persuade them to put pressure on their elected representatives in any way we could and in any way that was available to us . 
however , in terms of the role of parliament , i find myself powerfully swayed by the argument that this is one of the very few cases where the decision must be theirs . 
senator kinsella : 
the second preambular paragraph of the bill says that the break - up of a country - and , in this case it is canada that they are talking about - " is a matter of the utmost gravity . " 
if the senate of canada does not have a determinative role in the process that deals with matters of the utmost gravity , what impact does that have upon matters of less than utmost gravity that also come before this place ? 
senator fraser : 
with respect , i do not think it has any impact at all . 
there are various kinds of subjects that can be considered to be of the utmost gravity . 
clearly , ones that have a legal component , as an eventual constitutional amendment would have , rightly must come before us . 
it is my view - and , it has been my view for many years - that this key significance is primarily political and from that flows the reasoning that i tried to outline , perhaps inadequately , in my remarks . 
senator kinsella : 
does the honourable senator agree that this bill , if it becomes law , will establish , for the first time in canada ' s 133 - year history , a statutory legal means which , if followed , will provide for the legal breakup of canada ? 
senator fraser : 
this bill does not provide for the legal breakup of canada . 
this bill provides for a determination of a political process , the end result of which , if it came to that , would be a constitutional amendment that would be brought before us . 
that is what would provide for the breakup for canada . 
i do not , however , think it inappropriate for us to contemplate , in this place , the possibility that we may find ourselves engaged in that process . 
we have found ourselves very nearly engaged in that process already . 
the federal side - and this would have been true of whatever federal government was in power - had nothing to fall back on . 
that is to say , it had no instrument or route map to follow , had the result of the 1995 referendum gone the other way . 
the then government of quebec had a very detailed plan about what it should do . 
it did not really need a whole lot of prior legal arrangements because it had just one legislature with which to deal . 
the federal side , on the other hand , had not only parliament to take into account but also the undoubted state of great concern in all provinces outside quebec . 
this is a very legitimate way to begin the process of saying - that is , if it comes to the point where we will have to ask parliament to legislate on the secession of a province - " here is the beginning of the process that everyone will know we will be following . " 
senator kinsella : 
in the final paragraph in the advisory opinion of the supreme court - that is , in the opinion upon which the bill and the proponents of the bill tell us this bill is based , namely , paragraph 155 - the court also tells us that , notwithstanding what it said before about this process , which is similar to the one that bill c - 20 envisages , unconstitutional or illegal declaration of independence could occur . 
is that the same kind of situation to which the honourable senator was referring as that mr. parizeau articulated a couple of years ago ? 
more importantly , if the supreme court tells us that udi is still a possibility , how does this bill help ? 
senator fraser : 
my recollection of them is that he was planning to move very quickly if he got a 50 per cent plus 1 majority in his referendum , despite the confusion in the mind of some voters . 
he was moving very quickly to create facts on the ground - that is , the kind of things that were addressed in the supreme court discussion on effectivity , among other things . 
he was planning to seek recognition , if not of independence , at least of the inevitability of independence from foreign governments . 
he also had great financial plans for intervention on the markets , although that does not concern us here . 
i think he was trying to create a situation in which , around the world , it would be seen as inevitable that quebec would , very rapidly , become independent as a result of that vote . 
thus , the government of canada would be backed into a corner where it had no option but to negotiate quite rapidly . 
i may be wrong , but that is my impression of what mr. parizeau was intending to do . 
could i ask senator kinsella to repeat his second question ? 
senator kinsella : 
in paragraph 155 of the advisory opinion of the supreme court , the court opines that , notwithstanding what they had said before , " a unilateral , unconstitutional , illegal declaration of secession is still a possibility . " 
the court has told us , in black and white , that a udi secession is still a possibility . 
if it is still a possibility , then of what benefit is this law ? 
senator fraser : 
senator kinsella will recall that i noted that i am not the member of this chamber with the greatest legal expertise . 
however , in my reading of the supreme court opinion , it warns that the failure of the federal government to negotiate in good faith following a clear majority response to a clear question would be one of the grounds upon which a unilateral declaration of independence might succeed . 
i do not believe any senator in this chamber wishes to see a unilateral declaration of independence . 
the utility of this bill is that it demonstrates clearly , ahead of time and for all parties to be aware of , that , if it came to that , the federal government would , as the supreme court has said it would have to do , negotiate in good faith , but only under conditions of democratic certainty about as to the true will of the citizenry . 
in other words , this bill would greatly diminish the possibility of finding ourselves confronted with a udi . 
hon. lowell murray : 
accepting the stated purpose of the government that what is important is to have a clear , legal framework for any possible secession negotiations , why does my honourable friend suppose that the terms of reference provided to the court were so limited ? 
why does she suppose that the lawyers for the attorney general of canada specifically told the court not to pronounce itself on the question of what amending formula would be applicable to secession ? 
why does she suppose that the lawyers for the attorney general of canada told the court not to pronounce itself on the rights of the aboriginal peoples of quebec , notwithstanding the fact that representatives of those peoples put forward a very strong case to the court that there could be no change in their status vis - à - vis the federal crown and parliament without their consent ? 
senator fraser : 
as senator murray knows , i was not a member of parliament , nor was i an advisor to the government when its position before the supreme court was being drafted . 
i cannot possibly tell him why they made the decisions they made . 
i observe that if one were going to the supreme court on a matter of such immense gravity , one would want clarity of opinion . 
one would have to take into account the fact that one hoped gravely that this opinion would not actually come into play any time soon , perhaps not for generations , and that circumstances - for example , the status of aboriginal peoples , as the debate earlier today suggested - can change dramatically from now to then . 
therefore , one would wish to have the supreme court confine itself to the very heart of the issue in question . 
however , i do not know if that was their reasoning . 
the honourable senator might have a chance to ask that question when the bill reaches committee . 
senator murray : 
if i get the opportunity , i will certainly do so . 
i have one other question . 
my honourable friend would be justified in declining it as hypothetical , but i think it is pertinent . 
the intent of this bill is to ensure , so it seems , that the federal government will not negotiate the secession of a province unless there has been a clearly expressed will on the part of the people of that province to secede . 
if in the next referendum the government of quebec asks the people to give it a mandate to negotiate " a new association with canada , " will the provisions of this bill kick in ? 
will parliament then be called upon to decide whether that question is clear ? 
should the federal government tell them to get lost ? 
should the government call a referendum of its own ? 
what advice would the honourable senator give to the government under those circumstances ? 
senator fraser : 
the future holds too many variables to know what humble advice i might proffer should anyone be interested in having it . 
however , in connection with my honourable friend ' s cleverly worded question , it would seem the first order of business would be to determine , as clearly as possible from the debates in the national assembly and from any other available information , whether the association sought would , in fact , constitute some form of re - association after secession or whether it would constitute some form of rearrangement within confederation . 
clearly , that determination cannot be addressed in a bill such as this because there is an infinite number of potential answers . 
we would have to wait upon the day . 
hon. g é rald - a . 
the government could have not passed any legislation , and merely used the supreme court opinion . 
it exercised its prerogative to express its point of view . 
it could have chosen the route of a statement by the prime minister and his cabinet . 
it could have chosen the legislative route , and that is what it did . 
however , if the bill is passed , the government will have to heed the house of commons . 
i cannot understand why it would not heed the senate , which is on an equal footing with the house of commons legislatively . 
why are mps ' opinions sought , but not senators ' ? 
we may be consulted , but no more . 
why would the senate not also be entitled , as a legislative chamber - we are also part of parliament - to pass a resolution on this ? 
we are going against the principle of the equality of the two houses . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
honourable senators , i am sorry to interrupt , but it is six o ' clock . 
do i have the permission of the senate not to see the clock ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
the question is simple . 
if one has chosen the legislative path , one must follow the principles of the legislative power of the state . 
the senate could , however , pass the bill and then , later , consider what we have done , but they are not obliged to do so . 
it is the sole responsibility of house of commons to tell the government that it should not negotiate because the question is not clear . 
the government has the obligation to heed the opinion of the house of commons . 
the government has the choice to act alone because the government is the executive , or it may choose to involve parliament , but parliament is composed of two houses . 
i do not understand why one house is so privileged at an important moment in our history , and the other is not . 
it is a complete mystery to me . 
if it is a question of time , the senate can sit within 30 days and come to a conclusion within 30 days . 
why not ? 
senator fraser : 
honourable senators , this is what i was trying to address , obviously not with total persuasive power , in my initial remarks . 
it seems to me that there is a very strong argument that , when we get to that day , in fact , it is the role of the other place to make the decisions . 
senator beaudoin : 
uniquely ? 
senator fraser : 
yes. 
i think that it is a remarkable sign of deference to the whole of parliament that the government has chosen to take this legislative step to establish that principle for the future . 
it might have chosen only to have a resolution in the house of commons , and nothing we said or did could have stopped that . 
i am referring to a resolution now , containing the essence of bill c - 20 . we would not have had a word to say about that . 
however , we do have a word to say about it . 
we have already had words . 
i listened to the leader ' s speeches . 
they are of wonderful quality . 
listening to the grilling i am getting here , i can tell that this entire debate will be of very high quality . 
we are , in fact , involved at this point . 
however , if we pass this bill , we will acknowledge , and in my view probably correctly , that it is , in the end , the other place that will have to make the decision if it comes to that . 
why do anything at all now since the supreme court has given its opinion ? 
when i listened to the first responses from the government of quebec , i was encouraged in that view , but then last fall we started hearing from the relevant minister in the government of quebec , not once but repeatedly , that they were not bound by and would not respect the opinion of the supreme court on this matter . 
i think at that point , there was a duty incumbent upon the government of canada to respond , and this is the response it has chosen to make . 
senator beaudoin : 
remember the case of the " particular status for quebec " , and remember the case of the " four vetoes " . 
the senate was involved . 
if you do not want the senate to be involved , you must follow the constitution . 
if you want to erode one power of the senate , you cannot do it by a simple statute . 
you must do it by a constitutional amendment . 
in 1982 , we lost our absolute veto in constitutional matters , but that was a decision of those who were amending the constitution . 
it was a constitutional amendment , not a statute . 
how can you change the parliamentary system by a simple statute ? 
i see no precedent for that in our parliamentary history . 
just the other day senator boudreau spoke about the question of timing . 
the senate certainly has as much time in this house to do it as do members of the house of commons . 
there are 304 members , and here we are only 105 senators . 
i think we can act within the same time frame as the house of commons . 
again , it was up to the government to say , " since we are the cabinet , since we are the executive of this country , we will do it alone . " 
i have the greatest respect for that , and we have done that for more than a century . 
now we want to change it . 
i have no objection , providing we follow the principles of the constitution . 
senator fraser : 
it is very difficult to take on senator beaudoin on matters of constitutional principles . 
however , let me offer the cautious observation that i do not think that the senate has ever had any power to influence , ahead of time , a decision about whether or not a government would enter into constitutional negotiation . 
therefore , we are not losing any power . 
the house of commons has had that power indirectly in that it is a confidence chamber . 
knowing that the government of the day was embarked upon constitutional negotiations , the commons could choose to curtail that process by defeating the government , if it wished it to do so . 
this process strikes me as a variant of that process - a very interesting variant couched to meet changing circumstances . 
not many parliamentary democracies have gone through this exercise . 
its political role may not be all that we might have wished , but that will depend to a great extent on what we make of our political role , if the day ever comes . 
senator beaudoin : 
i have one word on the vote of confidence . 
the honourable senator is right : the house of commons can always have a vote of confidence , but that is not what the bill is saying . 
the bill is saying , " if the house of commons comes to the conclusion that the question is not clear and that the majority is not clear , it will have to order the government of this country not to negotiate . " 
this is quite a power . 
it differs from a vote of confidence . 
why do they have that power ? 
they have that power because the statute states that they have that power . 
i think it is right , legally speaking , but what i think is wrong is the absence of the senate at the stage of the negotiations . 
it is not more ; it is not less . 
senator fraser : 
honourable senators , it strikes me that perhaps the key words in that obviously interesting and thought - provoking argument are when the honourable said , " ... what i think is wrong ... " 
senator beaudoin : 
that is my opinion . 
it may be wrong . 
senator fraser : 
in the end , it comes down to whether we think it is not constitutionally but politically right or wrong . 
hon. john lynch - staunton ( leader of the opposition ) : 
honourable senators , senator fraser supports the argument advanced by her leader , the leader of the government in the senate , that the senate ' s role in the process leading up to a possible secession should be limited because the senate only has a suspensive veto when it comes to constitutional amendment . 
therefore , we are being limited to what i call a consultant in waiting . 
one clause of the bill states that we shall be consulted , amongst others , but it does not mean that anything we would provide as consultation will even be attended to . 
i find that a mystifying argument , one that i certainly do not accept , particularly as when it came to previous constitutional amendments that have come to this chamber since i have been here , the senate was a full participant in the process . 
i think of the constitutional amendment that eventually identified or proclaimed new brunswick as a bilingual province . 
i think of term 17 . 
i think of the constitutional amendment that allowed denominational schools to be replaced by a linguistic school system . 
the senate of canada was part of the entire process leading up to that constitutional amendment , to the point of being members on a joint committee with members of the house of commons . 
now we are talking about the possible constitutional amendment leading to the breakup of the country , and suddenly the senate , as an essential part of parliament , is dismissed . 
i cannot understand the rationale behind that argument . 
senator fraser : 
honourable senators , nothing in this bill changes the senate ' s role in any way . 
if we ever get to a constitutional amendment on the secession of a province , the regularly established constitutional and legislative process will come into play at that point and our role will be exactly as it has been . 
the honourable senator speaks of our role preceding the presentation of a constitutional amendment . 
while negotiations are going on , the role of members of either chamber is fairly limited , with the exception that the house of commons can indeed defeat the government , in which case the negotiations are probably suspended , if not halted . 
however , the role that we can ever play when any constitutional amendment is in the process of being negotiated will continue . 
if we want to take our case to public tribunals , we can . 
if we want to have special committees , we can . 
if we want to do special studies , we can . 
nothing will stop us . 
indeed , i would be astounded if we did not do all those things . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
but when we were involved in term 17 and the quebec school question , we joined with the house of commons in the consultation , the questioning and the examination of the entire question before the constitutional amendment was put to a vote . 
in this case , we are being told that we are not to be part of that preliminary process and that we are irrelevant when it comes to a constitutional amendment because we have only a six - month veto . 
we can only delay an amendment for six months . 
if that argument holds here , why was it not applied in term 17 , when we were involved with the process right from the beginning ? 
those hearings went on for a long time and were very valuable . 
not only was there a joint committee , but , after that and after the joint committee hearings on the quebec question , we had our own hearings here . 
i remember mr. dion coming here . 
i should like to think that the questions asked and the exchanges were valuable . 
the end result was that the amendments were obviously going to go through , but at least people had a better idea and a better understanding of what the two amendments , plus the one regarding new brunswick , involved because of the senate ' s participation in the process leading up to their passage . 
this is not just demeaning to the senate ; i think it is demeaning to the entire parliamentary process . 
i fail to understand why that process is being accepted and furthered through this bill . 
senator fraser : 
honourable senators , i really do differ with senator lynch - staunton on how he sees the process unfolding . 
nowhere in this bill does it change what has been written about our role , or non - role , in the actual conduct of the negotiations . 
all this bill does is set up a political framework whereby the starting political judgment will have to be made . 
hon. marcel prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , senator fraser said she did not really want to participate in the debate at this stage , but that she decided , for certain reasons , to do so . 
i feel the same way ; i do not want to take part in it at this point . 
i listened to senator fraser . 
i found her arguments disturbing . 
i wonder about the usefulness of the senate . 
senator fraser , who is a very well - known woman in quebec , was able to represent quebec ' s english minority at the right time . 
i prefer the term " english " to the term " anglophone " . 
we should have a debate to define these terms : francophone , anglophone , french - canadian and english - canadian . 
senator fraser is a very eloquent personality among quebec ' s english minority , as she has demonstrated on numerous occasions . 
i was a bit lost when i heard her comments about the senate . 
when i came here , i thought this was a house of sober second thought . 
this is what is written in the speaker ' s chambers . 
order excludes haste and precipitation . 
honourable senators , we are both montrealers . 
i was a member of parliament for 30 years . 
i know the haste and often the panic with which my honourable friends from the other place can act . 
i will tell you what a member of parliament , who eventually became prime minister , always said : 
" don ' t worry , prime minister , we will pass that on a friday . " 
it is always distressing to see the members of the party in power , in a panic and under the sway of public opinion , propose bills that were not properly discussed . 
the senate plays its role . 
senators joyal and de ban é know that , when prime minister trudeau , thinking he had detected agreement among the provinces , even though quebec was not a party , said that if he could get the support of the provinces and the members , he would not let the senate prevent him from concluding an agreement . 
from there , i think the idea of the suspensive six month veto arose . 
six months provides time for thought . 
it is a nice cool - off period . 
there is nothing worse than mob rule . 
this is written in the speaker ' s chambers , as you know . 
it is better for reason to triumph over public opinion and over public demonstrations . 
that is what concerns me . 
as a senator , i took a stand just before my arrival in the senate during the debate on the religious question in newfoundland . 
i will never forgive myself for defending this principle . 
i was the first to take part in the debate . 
as i was alone , i listened . 
the official opposition pursued the debate . 
one of the roles of the senate is to defend the minorities . 
in this country , the word minority refers only to the french - speaking or the english - speaking minority . 
there are minorities of all sorts and there are the regions . 
i wonder why we have a senate . 
suddenly people will say : 
forget the senate ! 
i listened carefully to senator fraser ' s description of those days . 
she mentioned 1968 , but we could go back to 1960 . 
so i voted in favour . 
it is in the speech i gave so i am not making anything up today . 
it was unbelievable what we were asked to do back then , in the heat of the moment . 
i swore i would not go through it again . 
the more i listen , the more i am troubled . 
i wonder what the senate is doing and what its role is . 
i would never interfere in the first nations because they were there before me . 
i wish them justice . 
we must protect minorities . 
we ignored one of our duties when we became involved in the issue of religion in newfoundland and even in quebec . 
i was opposed in both cases . 
i am a traditionalist . 
i do not see why one should become something one is not simply in order to accommodate people . 
we have opinions , people to represent , and that is what the senate is there for . 
i think that the role of the senate is too easily and too quickly dismissed in such an important issue . 
i will not deny that i would have preferred that it not come to this . 
if ever quebec asks ambiguous questions , the federal government has only to refuse to negotiate . 
what then ? 
there is an impasse . 
there is talk of a majority of two thirds of the electoral list . 
this worries me even more . 
we are creating problems where none exist . 
i am a french - canadian from quebec , and within canada i am a member of a minority . 
this has not given me an inferiority complex , nor has it her , from what i know about her . 
that is the beauty of canada . 
is her conception of the senate that we are used when it suits , and avoided if it might bring about a bit of a delay ? 
there are other ways . 
they could propose amendments to us with the stipulation that there will be a total of six days debate in the senate . 
what does the senate do ? 
it is used when it suits , and when things get complicated , it is not . 
everyone has an opinion on the senate . 
i would like to have senator fraser ' s comments because i know that they will be well thought out . 
senator fraser : 
flattery , senator prud ' homme , will get you nowhere . 
senator prud ' homme : 
well , it got me here , the same as you . 
senator fraser : 
senator prud ' homme asks for my conception of the role of the senate . 
i have always had the greatest respect for the senate . 
long before i came here , i said that a chamber such as ours is essential to a federation , for regional representation , representation of minorities , but above all , to use the classic phrase as " the chamber of sober second thought " . 
why am i convinced that it is so important ? 
because of my life - long career in journalism , i realize everyone needs an editor , someone to see that what we have written is understandable , grammatical and respects the code of ethics . 
no one can be sure that they have written a text , be it for a column or for a piece of legislation , that is without error . 
there are very few cases in parliament in which the senate does not have a role to play : the choice of government and the spending power . 
there is quite a strong argument . 
this case , too , involves a fundamental political decision that should be within the power of the house of commons . 
who forms the government ? 
it involves no legislation , it is a political choice . 
how should public funds be spent ? 
it is a political choice . 
do we or do we not recognize the will of the people of one part of our country to leave us ? 
this is an essentially political decision . 
we will have our say , but there is a certain legitimacy , morally speaking , in the fact that , in the end , it will be up to the house of commons to decide . 
senator prud ' homme : 
the honourable senator has just convinced me of the total opposite with her arguments . 
i am sure of the importance of the senate . 
i do not hide that from you . 
the beauty here in the senate is that we still have senators who listen to others and make up their mind as they go along . 
for example , in the area of agriculture , i prefer to listen to two or three senators who know more about the matter than i do , before i make up my mind . 
i have confidence in these people . 
senator fraser just convinced me that those who are called the wise people should not be consulted . 
the spending power and the power to defeat the government are part of the tradition , but on the issue of breaking up a country made up of regions . 
and the senate should not even get involved in the issue of the breakup of a country based on regions . 
they will suggest that we strike a committee and discuss the issue , but regardless of the decision made , it will not mean anything . 
this worries me . 
i do not know how i will vote . 
i thought this would probably be the senate ' s finest hour , the most important debate of my life . 
as i said , i am prepared to defend my position before the members of the parti qu é b é cois and the bloc qu é b é cois . 
canada is indivisible , provided we respect its specificities , provided we respect its regions , provided everyone feels at home . 
if one of the founding groups does not feel at home , the canadian federation will not work . 
this is why , in their wisdom , the parliamentarians of the time created the senate . 
they had already anticipated the possibility of incredible debates that would need to be toned down . 
i am prepared to have this debate with members of parliament any time . 
honourable senators , perhaps , at the end of the debate , we can come up with an amendment that would allow the senate to play the role for which it was created . 
hon. nicholas w . taylor : 
honourable senators , i have a short question for senator fraser who has done a very good job of explaining the position - a very difficult position from where i stand , although not an impossible one . 
my question follows the theory developed by the leader of the government , and elaborated upon by senator fraser . 
it has to do with the question of deciding on a referendum to separate , whether it be in alberta , cape breton or quebec , which is essentially a decision for the cabinet and the house to make . 
senator fraser went on to say that it could also be done by way of resolution . 
that is quite correct . 
in her short time here , the honourable senator has turned into a parliamentary whiz . 
why was this provision put into the bill and brought to the senate in the first place ? 
was it to rub our noses in the fact that we were not to have any power ? 
is there some reason for bringing a bill to the senate on something over which the honourable senator has said we have no authority with which to deal ? 
senator fraser : 
honourable senators , i expect that we will hear from representatives of the government in due course in this debate . 
i will not hazard any reasons for their motivation . 
we have heard from the leader of the government , and i expect we will hear from him again , as well as from other ministers as time goes on . 
i do not think this bill rubs our noses in anything . 
this bill sets out ahead of time the process the present government of canada believes would be the appropriate process for any federal government to follow if it were confronted with a strong secessionist movement , and a referendum . 
i think that this government ' s judgment on what is the appropriate course is entirely defensible . 
i think the course they have chosen is legitimate . 
why ? 
because there was a vacuum , and because we have , in quebec , a provincial government , as i said in response to an earlier question , in which responsible ministers are saying that quebec would not have to respect the opinion of the supreme court of canada . 
senator taylor : 
i have no problem with that . 
my problem is with why this particular bill was brought to the senate . 
why not just use a resolution in the house of commons to put through a clarity position ? 
in other words , why bring a bill to us telling us that we have no power ? 
i do not see any point in that , unless the government is trying to set a precedent . 
if it is trying to set a precedent , what is that precedent ? 
senator fraser : 
it is a statement by way of legislation . 
therefore , it comes to us . 
if the government of canada had chosen , it could have simply made this decision statement by way of resolution in the house of commons . 
it would not have had to consult us at all . 
it is consulting us now . 
on motion of senator kinsella , debate adjourned .

prime minister of japan 
condolences and wishes of early recoveryfrom sudden illness 
hon. dan hays ( deputy leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , on saturday night , his excellency keizo obuchi , prime minister of japan , fell ill and was admitted to hospital . 
as honourable senators are aware , prime minister obuchi suffered a stroke and is in a coma . 
i know all honourable senators join me in offering sympathy to the japanese people and their government . 
i have spoken to ambassador katsuhisa uchida to convey these sentiments , which have been acknowledged by acting prime minister aoki . 
i extend our sympathy to his excellency ' s family , especially his wife , chizuko obuchi , the members of the diet and of his party . 
we wish his excellency a return to health , as the japanese people have been well served by his invaluable talents as a political leader . 
prime minister obuchi ' s political career and his long - standing interest in foreign relations brought him into frequent contact with canada . 
i met with the then foreign minister obuchi as minister axworthy ' s envoy to japan to encourage japan ' s participation in the convention against anti - personnel mines . 
minister obuchi not only received me warmly , but also actively encouraged his government to sign the convention . 
he was in ottawa in december 1997 to sign the convention . 
he also greeted prime minister chr é tien and the entire team canada mission to japan with great warmth and ensured the success of the trade mission . 
we will miss him as prime minister . 
for one so young , he has had a notable and extraordinary political career . 
we wish him our best . 
plight of street children 
hon. sharon carstairs : 
the filmmaker is andr é e cazabon . 
she is also the street child depicted in the film . 
at the age of 14 , she took to the streets of ottawa , montreal and toronto . 
through the efforts of operation go home and through the help and assistance of rideauwood addiction and family services , andr é e left the streets , received treatment for her addiction to drugs , returned to school and became a film producer . 
she is one of the lucky ones . 
the letters were written to her by her father , a teacher in orleans , which is just east of ottawa . 
he wrote to her while she was on the streets . 
his agony and that of his whole family is depicted in this film . 
it is not an easy film to watch , but as lawmakers and service providers it is very important that we do so . 
today , honourable senators will receive in their offices a letter from the honourable ethel blondin - andrew explaining how to gain access to this film through the house of commons broadcasting branch . 
honourable senators , in the question and answer session following the presentation , i asked andr é e why she had taken to the streets . 
she said it was because of a sexual assault that took place while she had been on a visit to a farm . 
physical and sexual assaults are reasons our young people turn to the streets , yet we have few treatment programs available for them . 
every single agency in canada engaged in this work has a waiting list . 
most provinces do not have residential treatment facilities . 
there is one , for example , in all of ontario and it is located in thunder bay . 
honourable senators , children as young as 10 take to our streets . 
are they not worth saving ? 
if they are worth saving , why are we not doing it ? 
senegal 
new government 
the hon. the speaker : 
honourable senators , i am taking advantage of rule 55 ( 2 ) to make a statement which i believe is important from a democratic standpoint . 
over the weekend , i represented the government of canada canada at the swearing in of the new president of senegal in dakar . 
i rise today to speak about this event because , in my view , it was an amazing tribute to democracy . 
for the first time in that country , a change of government was brought about on a totally peaceful basis . 
the new president , abdoulaye wade , whom i have known for some 25 years , was the leader of the opposition for all that time . 
in the early years , there was little hope of bringing about change . 
that was the view held by most senegalese . 
this recent election brought about change . 
a new government was elected . 
the retiring president has accepted the result most gracefully . 
the incoming president has asked the retiring president to represent him at a major african conference in egypt this coming weekend . 
the whole thing has been done in a perfectly democratic fashion . 
i had the good fortune of speaking to a few young senegalese . 
they said to me , " we had given up hope on democracy . 
it was always the same . 
it did not matter what we did ; there were always the same people in office . " 
quite obviously , i make no comment from a partisan standpoint , only on the general principle that democracy prevailed . 
honourable senators would have enjoyed the enthusiasm there . 
one hundred thousand senegalese came into the stadium for the swearing - in ceremony . 
it was the most impressive ceremony i have ever seen , and it was without expensive pageantry . 
it was simply 100,000 people cheering , absolutely convinced that they had made a change . 
cancer awareness month 
hon. mabel m. deware : 
honourable senators , on this first sitting day of april , i am pleased to see that many in the chamber are wearing daffodil pins in support of cancer awareness month in canada . 
it is an opportunity for canadians to reflect on how cancer has changed our lives , to renew our commitment to a healthy lifestyle , and to help fund research that can improve cancer prevention and treatment . 
one day we hope to find a cure . 
the importance of cancer awareness month cannot be overstated when you consider that one in three canadians will develop some form of cancer in his or her lifetime . 
i could recite some pretty grim statistics about the tens of thousands of canadians who will be diagnosed with cancer this year alone and the tens of thousands more who will die from it . 
today , i want to focus on something more positive : the hope and faith that cancer can be beaten . 
the canadian cancer society has adopted the daffodil , a bright , cheerful flower that heralds the arrival of spring as its symbol of hope . 
indeed , hope underlies all of the important work done by the canadian cancer society . 
the society , which relies entirely on donations , is the largest single funder of cancer research in canada today . 
it also offers public education programs to promote prevention and early detection of cancer . 
it provides patient services to meet the social , spiritual , emotional and informational needs of people with cancer and their families . 
cancer touches all of our lives . 
i know all honourable senators will join me in applauding the courage of people with cancer , their friends and their families , and in saluting the canadian cancer society and its 350,000 volunteers . 
new government 
hon. consiglio di nino : 
honourable senators , upon hearing of the strides democracy is making around the world , i thought it would be appropriate to comment on what has happened recently in taiwan . 
until 1988 , there was no democracy in taiwan . 
ever since chiang kai - shek and his followers fled to taiwan , the party he once led has controlled power with a very heavy hand . 
in 1988 , democratic elections were first held in taiwan . 
on my behalf and on behalf of all honourable senators , i wish mr. chen good luck and many good years of democratic government .

scrutiny of regulations 
second report of joint committee presented 
hon. c é line hervieux - payette : 
honourable senators , i have the honour to present the second report of the standing joint committee on scrutiny of regulations , relating to section 36 ( 2 ) of the ontario fishery regulations , 1989 , as enacted by sor / 89 - 93 . 
question period 
delayed answers to oral questions 
hon. dan hays ( deputy leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , i have response to a question raised in the senate on march 21 , 2000 , by senator stratton , regarding the farm crisis in the prairie provinces , flooding problems in manitoba and saskatchewan ; a response to a question raised in the senate on march 21 , 2000 , by senator atkins , regarding residency requirements for job applicants ; a response to a question raised in the senate on march 22 , 2000 , by senator andreychuk , regarding china , influence of environmental policy in granting of funds to three gorges dam project ; and a response to a question raised in the senate on march 23 , by senator forrestall , regarding sea king helicopters , level of flight training for pilots . 
agriculture and agri - food 
farm crisis in prairie provinces - flooding problem in manitoba and saskatchewan - request for response 
( response to question raised by hon. terry stratton on march 21 , 2000 ) 
the government of canada has made a number of changes to existing safety net programs to help farmers who were unable to seed due to wet weather conditions last spring . 
in partnership with the government of saskatchewan , the government announced a $ 50 per acre benefit for those with unseeded acres . 
this offer was open to the government of manitoba as well . 
the government extended the seeding deadlines for crop insurance . 
the government changed the agricultural income disaster assistance ( aida ) program to allow farmers to get interim payments on their 1999 benefits earlier . 
the government adjusted the net income stabilization account ( nisa ) program rules to permit easier access to those funds . 
the aida program is designed to provide benefits to farmers who suffer severe income drops regardless of the circumstance . 
this would include farmers who are unable to seed due to wet weather . 
projected dfaa expenditures in saskatchewan are estimated at $ 2.5 million , which would result in a federal share of about $ 1 million . 
losses in the agricultural sector not eligible for cost - sharing under the dfaa are being dealt with through aida . 
environment 
residency requirement for job applicants 
( response to question raised by hon. norman k . atkins on march 21 , 2000 ) 
environment canada does not have a residency requirement . 
the public service employment act , the legislation that governs hiring for much of the public service of canada , allows the public service commission , in its role as hiring agent , to establish geographic , organizational and occupational criteria that prospective candidates must meet in order to be eligible for appointment . 
while the public service commission often requires that potential candidates be residents of canada , this is not an absolute , inflexible rule . 
the commission ' s practice has been to include canadians who apply in competitions opened to the public , if they are outside the country on a temporary basis and have a permanent residence in the area of selection . 
export development canada 
china - influence of environmental policy in granting of funds to three gorges dam project 
canada ' s position is that the advantages ( flood control , power generation and inland shipping ) and disadvantages ( environmental issues and human displacement ) of undertaking the project have been weighed carefully by the chinese . 
after considerable studies , analysis and deliberations , the chinese government concluded that the imperative of flood control and the benefits of power - generation and transportation outweigh any negative environmental impact of proceeding with the project . the 
need to mitigate annual floods caused by the yangtze river is china ' s fundamental rationale for proceeding with the project . 
severe flooding in the yangtze river basin has killed thousands and caused significant damage in nearby communities . 
the chinese government has already demonstrated that it is managing resettlement in a manner which minimizes hardship for the local population . 
the project will also generate substantial electrical power and improve navigational access to china ' s interior . 
the project will meet about 9 percent of china ' s current but rapidly growing power needs . 
this is renewable energy and considerably cleaner than the coal - fired plants that account for three quarters of china ' s energy and contribute to global warming . 
in addition , the involvement of canadian companies could help mitigate any negative environmental effects of the project , as the high environmental standards and practices of canadian suppliers would be made available to the chinese project team . 
national defence 
sea king helicopters - level offlight training for pilots 
the minister of national defence has stated on numerous occasions that the canadian forces need to replace the sea king helicopters , and that the maritime helicopter project is his number one equipment priority . 
the safety of personnel is of the utmost importance and this is a principle the canadian forces won ' t compromise . 
the canadian forces take every step necessary to ensure that sea kings operate safely until such time as a new maritime helicopter enters service . 
the air force follows a very strict maintenance and inspection regime , and the sea kings are upgraded as necessary . 
as for the level of flying training , sea king crews continue to meet the strictest training requirements . 
the air force continuously strives to maintain a training program that is adapted to both the capabilities and likely tasks of the sea kings . 
the sea king crews are provided with the appropriate level of flying hours to ensure that they maintain all the skills they need to perform a wide range of missions and respond to a broad range of situations . 
the recent rescue of 13 crew members from a panamanian cargo ship underscores the validity and effectiveness of sea king crew training . 
orders of the day 
nisga ' a final agreement bill 
third reading - debate continued 
on the order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the honourable senator austin , p . c . , seconded by the honourable senator gill , for the third reading of bill c - 9 , to give effect to the nisga ' a final agreement . 
( debate suspended march 30 , 2000 ) . 
the hon. the speaker : 
hon. jack austin : 
the hon. the speaker : 
is it agreed , honourable senators ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
the hon. the speaker : 
we will then conclude with the answers to the questions that were asked of the honourable senator austin . 
senator austin : 
on page 906 of the debates of the senate for march 30 , he asked : 
is there any possibility the transfer funds can be withheld if financial accountability is not being satisfied within these particular nations ? 
does the province and the federal government have the right to withhold funding ? 
honourable senators , with respect to financial accountability , the nisga ' a government must meet similar standards of financial administration as other governments and must publish its laws in a public registry . 
where canada or british columbia provide funding for programs or services delivered by the nisga ' a government , audited financial statements must be provided and the auditor general can review these statements . 
in the case of federal funding , the full authority of the financial administration act would apply to any and all transfer payments . 
in addition , the three parties to the nisga ' a final agreement have entered into a companion agreement , separate from the treaty , called the fiscal financing agreement . 
it is not a treaty and therefore not protected by section 35 of the constitution act , 1982 . 
the fiscal financing agreement specifies that the funding provided by canada and british columbia to the nisga ' a nation and sets out the responsibilities of the nisga ' a government in delivering agreed - upon programs and services . 
the fiscal financing agreement specifies , in paragraph 87 , the circumstances that would constitute a default , including failure to meet responsibilities , as well as bankruptcy or insolvency . 
paragraph 90 sets out the right of the funding party to deduct from payments the amounts that were to be provided for the provision of the affected programs or services . 
the fiscal financing agreement also provides for the establishment of a tripartite finance committee comprised of federal , provincial and nisga ' a representatives that will monitor financial arrangements between the parties and assist in resolving any issues that emerge . 
this committee is designed to prevent potential defaults from occurring . 
lastly , it should be noted that the fiscal financing agreement must be renegotiated every five years . 
honourable senators , i believe these provisions and the various checks and balances represent the highest standards for accountability that could be expected from government anywhere . 
i will send over to senator st. germain two pages from the nisga ' a fiscal financing agreement that contain the default and remedies from section 87 through to section 92 . 
honourable senators , senator beaudoin has commented on the role of a treaty under section 35 of the constitution as being constitutionally protected . 
senator beaudoin indicated that he would be completely satisfied with the constitutionality of this agreement if he was confident that it is a treaty under section 35 of the constitution . 
i should like to draw senator beaudoin ' s attention - and , indeed , the attention of the all honourable senators - to the provisions in bill c - 9 and in the nisga ' a final agreement itself that clarify this point . 
clause 3 of bill c - 9 states : 
the nisga ' a final agreement is a treaty and a land claims agreement within the meaning of sections 25 and 35 of the constitution act , 1982 . 
under the heading of " general provisions " in chapter 2 of the nisga ' a final agreement , paragraph 1 states : 
this agreement is a treaty and a land claims agreement within the meaning of sections 25 and 35 of the constitution act , 1982 . 
the honourable senator sparrow asked me questions with respect to polling . 
in my third reading remarks on march 30 , i advised that in 1998 , the polls showed that a majority of british columbians supported the nisga ' a final agreement . 
i also stated that : 
as the fortunes of the clark government sank to an all - time low in public esteem , the polls showed a modest decline in support for the agreement . 
senator sparrow asked me to elaborate on the polls , and i will do so as follows . 
vancouver sun political columnist vaughn palmer in a column dated december 2 , 1998 , refers to the findings of marktrend , a b.c. - based polling group not usually associated with the ndp , wherein 35 per cent of respondents did not know what they thought of the nisga ' a treaty , 12 per cent were unaware of it , 30 per cent were somewhat supportive , and 24 per cent were somewhat opposed . 
an october 22 , 1998 article by dianne rinehart reported that according to an angus read poll , 51 per cent of british columbians viewed the nisga ' a final agreement as a step in the right direction , with 33 per cent of those polled holding the opposite view and 16 per cent unsure of their views . 
the poll was described as having been conducted shortly after the nisga ' a final agreement was signed and prior to the initiation of court proceedings by the provincial liberal party and others . 
the ottawa citizen , in a story by rick molfina on november 6 , 1999 , carried the following comments : 
the attitudes of canadians toward aboriginal self - government are hardening , but a majority across canada and in british columbia support the historic nisga ' a treaty , a federal government survey shows . 
of those polled nationally who are following the treaty , 48 per cent strongly supported it , compared with 25 per cent who strongly opposed it . 
the remainder placed their support or opposition somewhere within a scale ranking their view from one to seven , with one representing strong opposition and seven representing strong support . 
of people polled in british columbia who are following the nisga ' a treaty , 41 per cent strongly supported the treaty , compared with 39 per cent who strongly opposed . 
honourable senators , i also wish to comment briefly on the issue of " repealability " which senator kinsella addressed . 
i am having more work done on that most interesting question . 
i hope to have an opportunity to rise again during the debate to answer that part of the honourable senator ' s question . 
the hon. the speaker : 
honourable senators , the honourable senator austin said he would like to reply at a later time to the request of the honourable senator kinsella . 
as senator austin does not have the right of reply at third reading , is it agreed that he be allowed to do that ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
hon. gerry st. germain : 
honourable senators , i have a question further to that of senator kinsella . 
in senator austin ' s reply , perhaps he could elaborate further on the non - delegation of this agreement where it is constitutionalized . 
he made reference to the fact that this was required for certainty , trust and various other reasons . 
all other agreements entered into with our native peoples , in the cases of sechelt , sawtooth , gwich ' in , yukon and various others , have been done on a delegated basis . 
is he saying that those agreements are in jeopardy ? 
i personally would be very concerned if his government feels that these particular agreements are in jeopardy due to the manner in which they were formed . 
as far as i am concerned , those agreements were entered into in good faith and are not in jeopardy . 
whether an agreement is delegated or not should make any difference to the honourable way it is carried out . 
the honourable senator may wish to answer this query later and tie it to the response to senator kinsella . 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , i have no difficulty in answering the question now . 
in terms of legal effect and the honour of the crown , whether it is protected by section 35 of the constitution act , 1982 or whether it is the subject of legislation through the delegation of power , the obligation is the same . 
i see no difference . 
i have no trouble with the validity of the existing agreements . 
nothing in bill c - 9 affects those existing agreements . 
i should have noted , while on my feet , that senator sparrow asked for a list of the witnesses who asked to appear but were declined and for additional information with respect to witnesses . 
that information has been supplied to senator sparrow and to all honourable senators who participated in the committee ' s work . 
hon. lowell murray : 
honourable senators , i think we have a problem here of consistency on the part of the government . 
the government recently refused what i considered to be a quite moderate proposal by grand chief phil fontaine for an amendment to bill c - 20 . that proposal would have assured the aboriginal peoples of quebec a seat at the negotiating table in the event of any secession negotiations . 
the government refused that proposal on the basis that the aboriginal peoples of quebec are not a party to the amending formula . 
yet we have in this bill , it appears , a proposal to entrench under section 35 a self - government agreement and a treaty with the nisga ' a in british columbia that simply sets aside the division of powers in the constitution act , 1867 . 
the honourable senator himself made the following statement about section 35 , as found at page 910 of the debates of the senate of thursday , march 30 , 2000 : 
i have no hang - up with respect to the division of powers between sections 91 and 92 . 
we took that decision in 1982 . 
some want to repeal section 35 . 
they want to argue from propositions that start without acknowledging its existence . 
i neither put myself nor other senators in that category . 
i was a sometime member of the joint senate - commons committee that studied the patriation resolution between 1980 and 1982 , as was senator joyal and as was my honourable friend . 
at least three of us who are here today were here that night in 1981 whensection 35 was approved . 
i remember well the very moving speech that senator austin made on that occasion , recalling his very first political assignment in ottawa as a political assistant to the honourable arthur laing , minister of indian affairs in the pearson government . 
i am sure he recalls it as well . 
i ask the honourable senator to reflect , first of all , on the circumstances under which the word " existing " was placed into section 35 . 
i say that the word " existing " was put there to calm certain people . 
by the time we got to section 35 , the patriation initiative had ceased to be an ottawa - new brunswick - ontario initiative . 
mr. trudeau , by that time , had nine provinces on board , as we know , and section 35 was the subject of some very intense and careful negotiation , as my friend will recall . 
i ask the honourable senator to reflect especially on the fact that , having agreed on section 35 , we went on to provide for a series of constitutional conferences , first ministers ' conferences , to discuss - and i quote from the section - matters that directly affect the aboriginal peoples of canada : 
... including the identification and definition of the rights of those peoples to be included in the constitution of canada ... 
that suggests to me that we will be taking considerable liberties with section 35 by purporting to entrench in it a self - government agreement or treaty that sets aside the division of powers in the 1867 constitution . 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , i think that senator murray ' s excellent comments more properly belong in debate than as a question . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
comment . 
senator austin : 
i will be happy when i close the debate to cover the same ground and to provide my comments . 
hon. gerald j . comeau : 
the official of the department of justice responded that this was not an exclusive fishery and , as such , the government had the right to allocate such entitlements to whomever it wished . 
however , at that time i suggested that if such entitlements are to be made that there should be competent legislation providing that right to government . 
once this entitlement belongs to the nisga ' a , it becomes a permanent allocation to the nisga ' a . 
as such , parliament can never touch it again because it is under section 35 protection . 
we are suggesting that parliament does not have the right to abdicate such responsibility over allocations of fish . 
given that i was not provided with an answer to this particular question , would senator austin have a more direct answer at this point ? 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , i have in front of me a letter , dated february 25 , sent to senator comeau by tom molloy , the federal chief negotiator . 
i will read to the senate the answer of the chief negotiator . 
i will not read every word , just the general sense of the letter , if i may . 
... you asked for my views on the question as to whether the nisga ' a treaty creates an " exclusive " fishery contrary to the magna carta . 
the magna carta of 1215 establishes a common law public right of access to the fishery . 
the magna carta was intended to limit the king ' s capacity as owner of the seabed to grant exclusive fishing rights . 
it should be noted that the aboriginal rights recognized and affirmed by s .35 ( 1 ) [ of the constitution act , 1982 ] exist within a legal context in which , since the time of the magna carta , there has been a common law right to fish in tidal waters that can only be abrogated by the enactment of competent legislation $ . 
while the elevation of common law aboriginal rights to constitutional status obviously has an impact on the public ' s common law rights to fish in tidal waters , it was surely not intended that , by the enactment of s .35 ( 1 ) , those common law rights would be extinguished in cases where an aboriginal right to harvest fish commercially existed $ . 
as a common law , not constitutional , right , the right of public access to the fishery must clearly be second in priority to aboriginal rights ; however , the recognition of aboriginal rights should not be interpreted as extinguishing the right of public access to the fishery . 
the magna carta was intended to limit the king ' s power to create exclusive fishing locations at which no other member of the public could fish . 
the gladstone case illustrates that aboriginal rights to fish do not give aboriginal people exclusive fishing locations at which no other member of the public can fish . 
aboriginal rights do not create exclusive property rights to fisheries in particular locations contrary to the magna carta . 
the analysis in gladstone applies to the nisga ' a treaty rights to fish . 
just as any nisga ' a aboriginal right to fish today on the nass river is not an exclusive property right that would extinguish any public access to the fishery , future nisga ' a treaty rights will not be exclusive property rights that would extinguish any public access to the fishery . 
both aboriginal and treaty rights to fish are available only to the " aboriginal peoples of canada " as defined in the constitution act , 1982 . 
non - aboriginal canadians do not have a legal right to insist that they become members of any particular aboriginal community in order to obtain the benefit of being able to exercise aboriginal or treaty rights to fish . 
applying the gladstone case this does not mean that public access to the fishery is denied contrary to the magna carta . 
this is why , during the presentation to senators , we emphasized the fact the creation of nisga ' a treaty rights to fish , even though they are treaty rights only for nisga ' a persons , do not prevent members of the public from fishing . 
as indicated during the minister ' s presentation to senate by canada ' s legal counsel , putting in place the nisga ' a treaty will not prevent other groups from exercising any aboriginal rights to fish they might have , and will not prevent recreational and commercial fisherman from fishing under ordinary law . 
in this sense the exclusive allocation or percentage share of the fishery for the nisga ' a is not an " exclusive " fishery in the legal sense contemplated by cases dealing with the magna carta . 
the nisga ' a treaty is drafted so as to prevent the nisga ' a from having any exclusive rights to sell nass river salmon . 
the fisheries chapter prevents the nisga ' a from selling a particular salmon species when commercial and recreational fishermen are not allowed to target those same species . 
paragraph 33 of the fisheries chapter provides : 
if , in any year , there are no directed harvests in canadian commercial or recreational fisheries of a species of nass salmon , sale of that species of nass salmon harvested in directed harvests of that species in that year ' s nisga ' a fishery will not be permitted . 
the fact that no exclusive property right to the fishery is created is underscored by paragraph 3 of the fisheries chapter of the nisga ' a treaty which provides that : 
this agreement is not intended to alter federal and provincial laws of general application in respect of property in fish or aquatic plants . 
lastly , as our legal counsel discussed during the minister ' s presentation before the senate , the nisga ' a have no capacity to close any part of the nass river fishery or to prevent fishing by any other group . 
apart from conservation concerns which serve the interests of all fisheries participants , nothing in the treaty would require the department of fisheries and oceans to close nass river fisheries or deny to any members of the public who wish to fish a right of navigation on the nass river . 
in fact , paragraph 14 of the access chapter of the nisga ' a treaty specifically preserves all public rights of access on navigable waters within nisga ' a lands . 
yours truly , 
w . thomas molloy , q . c . 
senator comeau : 
there are many words and interpretations by mr. molloy , who is a negotiator , i understand , of this agreement . 
as such , it is not ours to give to whomever we wish . 
we would be relinquishing our parliamentary duty in this stewardship that we hold over this resource to the governor in council , and the governor in council would then assume that responsibility from us . 
as i understand it , parliament does not have the right to abdicate its responsibility , especially in a case where we do not even own the resource . 
senator austin : 
i can only reply by saying that i do not believe the letter was written to confuse anyone , and i do not feel confused by reading it . 
i believe i can understand its argument . 
in any event , the r . v. gladstone decision says , as i have already mentioned , that a common law right to fish in tidal waters can only be abrogated by the enactment of competent legislation . 
senator comeau : 
if such arrangements can be made , so that parliament can relinquish its responsibility over fisheries resources and hand over that responsibility to cabinet , and if cabinet can then turn around and hand over these resources to whomever it wishes - whether an aboriginal group , friends of the minister , or friends of the prime minister - does that not create a precedent whereby such resources as scallops on the east coast of canada could be allocated to certain groups in perpetuity ? 
is this what may be in store for atlantic coast lobsters ? 
will minister nault be given the power to allocate lobster stocks to groups of his choosing ? 
we may be establishing a precedent that should be given careful consideration . 
senator austin : 
i understand the concerns of senator comeau , although i do not believe they justifiably arise from this bill . 
the paragraph that i just read gives parliament the power , which it may choose to exercise , but in the nisga ' a case this has not been done , as the rest of the letter makes clear . 
it is not an exclusive fishery . 
therefore , the principles from which senator comeau originally argued do not apply . 
i understand the concern with respect to the allocation of fish and other seafood resources anywhere ; however , that is , in my view , a political question rather than a legal one . 
senator comeau : 
obviously , i must provide the honourable senator ' s response to both east coast fishing interests and west coast fishing interests , in order to advise them that this may be what is in store for east coast lobsters , the resource that is being requested at this time by certain groups . 
the senator says that it is a political question . 
it appears that the government has decided the direction of the political question . 
there may be opinions contrary to what the government is suggesting . 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , this legislation applies only to the nisga ' a . 
i do not at this time wish to discuss its extension . 
i do not speak for the government ; i am the sponsor of the bill . 
however , in my remarks closing debate at third reading i shall mention the marshall decision . 
senator comeau : 
honourable senators , the nisga ' a treaty also provides for non - salmon fisheries resources in the nass river valley . 
it gives the government the right to negotiate entitlements to those resources . 
in effect , parliament is giving cabinet carte blanche to assign allocations of the non - salmon resources . 
is this , as well , a precedent that will be established for fisheries resources all across canada ? 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , i think the rest of the topic can be canvassed when i conclude the debate . 
hon. a . raynell andreychuk : 
honourable senators , i hope that senator austin will bear with me while i ask a series of questions on minority rights . 
i will start with the canadian charter of rights and freedoms . 
in our hearings , we were told that the canadian charter would apply . 
however , the preamble of bill c - 9 says : 
whereas the nisga ' a final agreement states that the canadian charter of rights and freedoms applies to nisga ' a government in respect of all matters within its authority , bearing in mind the free and democratic nature of nisga ' a government as set out in the agreement ; 
it would appear that the canadian charter of rights , under section 25 , already takes into account the distinctive philosophies , traditions , and cultural practices of the aboriginal peoples . 
further , if we believe that this is a third level of government , section 33 would be employed and the aboriginal peoples could use it as a notwithstanding clause . 
therefore , why was it necessary to include the words following " the canadian charter of rights and freedoms applies " ? 
senator austin : 
i shall need to consider that question , honourable senators . 
i asked for notice of questions when we concluded on thursday last , and i have received none . 
the question asked by the honourable senator is a particularly interesting one , and one that i have not explored in detail . 
i look forward to doing so . 
senator andreychuk : 
i did not think this question would catch senator austin off guard , because i asked it repeatedly in committee . 
i shall await a reply to that question , and ask further questions in writing . 
the majority of the committee made an observation with which some of us did not agree . 
the last sentence reads : 
your committee therefore strongly urges the federal government and its negotiating partners to pursue vigorously all means at their disposal to ensure that overlap issues are resolved to the satisfaction of concerned first nations prior to the conclusion of future land claim agreements . 
if the gitanyow and gitxsan are acknowledged as first nations , and if they are acknowledged to be in negotiations with the federal government , why should their rights be less than those of other first nations , as would be the case if no further agreements are negotiated unless overlaps are resolved ? 
senator austin : 
we are not saying that at all . 
in the observation , we recognize the equity that is contained in the nisga ' a final agreement , which provides for adjustments , either to further negotiations or to the consequences of litigation . 
we also express our concern for future negotiations . 
we are asking the federal government and its negotiating partners to be vigorous , but we are not in any way asking them not to proceed with further agreements where they believe that the parties have negotiated in good faith and have meet the other tests that minister nault set out in his evidence . 
senator andreychuk : 
is the honourable senator saying that all efforts were made to settle the overlap issues before proceeding with negotiations and that , therefore , the minority gitxsan and gitanyow were not being prejudiced ? 
if that is the case , what is the point of the last sentence ? 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , we are saying that the agreement with the nisga ' a was concluded as a result of good faith negotiations and that the aboriginal rights of the gitxsan and gitanyow are not absolutely or ultimately compromised . 
if they established their rights either through negotiation or litigation , those rights will be taken into account in the nisga ' a agreement . 
i am sure that the honourable senator is very much aware of paragraphs 33 to 35 in the nisga ' a final agreement . 
senator andreychuk : 
i am pleased that senator austin mentioned those paragraphs . 
does he not believe that precisely those paragraphs point out that the government is not acting in an appropriate fiduciary way toward all aboriginals , that it has taken the side of the nisga ' a against the gitanyow and gitxsan ? 
it is good public policy to be seen to be supporting one aboriginal claim over another , if we accept the fundamental point that all aboriginals are first nations and should be treated equally by our government . 
senator austin : 
this question was fully dealt with by minister nault in his evidence . 
in order to avoid prejudicing other rights , the provisions of the nisga ' a final agreement preserve those rights if they are accepted through the negotiating process or through the courts . 
therefore , i believe that there is no basis to argue that the government of canada is in any way choosing sides or in any way acting prejudicially . 
senator andreychuk is arguing for a total stasis in treaty negotiations and the progress in the course of establishing agreements with aboriginal communities . 
she is arguing that the slowest ship in the convoy should determine the entire speed of the fleet . 
she is arguing that the gitanyow and gitxsan , in this particular case , should have the right to hold up the concluded negotiations between the nisga ' a , the government of british columbia and the government of canada until they , in their own discretion and their own time , decide they are willing to come to the table . 
we have had evidence from mr. molloy and others that the nisga ' a made every effort to come to a conclusion . 
the government was satisfied that the nisga ' a had negotiated in good faith , and it decided to proceed with the nisga ' a agreement . 
senator andreychuk : 
it is unfair to characterize my opinion as one where the government could not proceed . 
my question is not whether the federal government proceeded with the nisga ' a because , quite correctly , the federal government did proceed with the nisga ' a . 
if one reads the report of the royal commission on aboriginal peoples , and i believe that is one of the bases upon which the government proceeded , it states that all aboriginal nations can proceed at their own speed . 
if the nisga ' a were ready to proceed and were acting in good faith , then the federal government had a responsibility to enter into that arrangement and discussion . 
why did minister nault say that he believes the nisga ' a and not the gitanyow and gitxsan ? 
the argument is not to hold up the debate ; the argument is that the government took sides when it had other avenues , channels and legal recourses . 
senator austin : 
may i ask the honourable senator to what alternatives she refers ? 
senator andreychuk : 
the government could have instituted a dispute - resolution mechanism prior to continuing with the nisga ' a . 
that is what canada advocates around the world in our foreign policy . 
i can see why the nisga ' a would ask for compensation if their claim failed in court . 
at that stage the nisga ' a would be required to allocate resources , time and energy to administering the process . 
at that point , the government should have signalled to the gitanyow and gitxsan that those groups would be in the same position and would be offered the same compensation in a very public and open way . 
senator austin : 
the entire process was public and open . 
beyond that , we begin to dance on points of pins . 
senator andreychuk is entitled to her opinion , but i do not believe it is on based on the facts . 
senator andreychuk : 
i believe sections 33 to 35 are not dancing on the heads of pins . 
there is a clear difference between justice and the appearance of justice . 
if we are to have a just and fair system , it is not only that justice is done but that it appear to be done in the eyes of the people . 
pulling off a gitxsan - gitanyow negotiator and moving him to the nisga ' a and putting in sections 33 , 34 and 35 may not be a prejudice , but it is the appearance of prejudice that is damning . 
in fact , the gitanyow and gitxsan felt they had been prejudiced . 
i , for one , will not tell the aboriginal people that they were wrong and that their point of view with respect to how they can negotiate was inappropriate . 
my plea was for a better public policy that would not have put the gitanyow in that position . 
i do not believe i misunderstand sections 33 and 35 . 
i question the federal government practice that i hope will not be repeated . 
i believe the gitanyow and gitxsan have been prejudiced . 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , i look forward to senator andreychuk ' s contribution to the debate . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
she just made one . 
senator andreychuk : 
in february , the standing senate committee on aboriginal peoples table a unanimous report entitled " forging new relationships : 
aboriginal governance in canada . " 
recommendations 1 to 4 deal very much with what we believe the federal government should do and how it should approach section 35 and aboriginal peoples . 
we were very strong in saying that aboriginals define themselves . 
the aboriginals determine how they gain their inherent rights and self - government . 
recommendation 1 states : 
the committee recommends that flowing from section 35 of the constitution act , 1982 , federal approaches to engaging aboriginal peoples in self - government negotiations be flexible , inclusive and demonstrate sensitivity to the diverse historical and contemporary circumstances of aboriginal peoples and their aspirations for self - government . 
does the honourable senator austin believe that passing the nisga ' a agreement and forging ahead with the nisga ' a at this point is inclusive and involves the gitxsan and gitanyow ? 
are we not violating our own recommendations ? 
we say in recommendations 2 , 3 and 4 that the department of indian affairs and northern development is the wrong place to negotiate . 
the nisga ' a did what was right , but surely the federal government ' s approach does not comply with recommendations 1 to 4 of our report . 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , i see no inconsistency . 
hon. john lynch - staunton ( leader of the opposition ) : 
honourable senators , if i may return to the observations in the fourth report of the committee to which senator andreychuk touched upon but to which i do not believe senator austin responded directly . 
i will read the last sentence because i believe it contradicts what we are being asked to do . 
the last sentence is quite firm . 
it states : 
your committee therefore strongly urges the federal government and its negotiating partners to pursue vigorously all means at their disposal to ensure that overlap issues are resolved to the satisfaction of concerned first nations prior to the conclusion of future land claim agreements . 
the observation could not be clearer . 
if it is good for 50 - plus first nations to be assured that the overlap issues , as they exist , be resolved before a conclusion of future land claim agreements , why is that principle not applicable in this case ? 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , it was applied in this case . 
after vigorous pursuit of the settlement of overlapping claims , it proved impossible for the nisga ' a , the gitanyow and the gitxsan to settle those claims . 
since 1995 , the government of canada has laid down its policy with respect to the way in which it will conclude an agreement with an aboriginal community . 
as minister nault said in his concluding remarks , the government of canada has followed that policy with respect to the nisga ' a . 
it became satisfied that the nisga ' a had negotiated in good faith , had proven right of possession and the boundaries which they had submitted and that the province of british columbia was prepared to sign on to the agreement . 
in the final instance , after a vigorous pursuit going back years - certainly back to 1977 in some cases and 1991 in the principle agreement on negotiation signed by the northwest tribal council - the government of canada , nisga ' a and the government of the province of british columbia decided that they would come to an agreement with nisga ' a while preserving the rights , under sections 33 to 35 , of the gitxsan and the gitanyow to establish their claims . 
i believe that system is eminently equitable . 
it meets not only the tests of the standing senate committee on aboriginal peoples ' report to the senate but also the tests of the observation of the committee . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
if i heard the honourable senator austin correctly , the government took sides . 
it agreed with the nisga ' a ' s rejection of the other two nations ' claims and therefore went ahead with the agreement . 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , let me be as clear as i possibly can be . 
the government , after a long period of negotiation with all the parties , accepted the claims of the nisga ' a with respect to the boundaries and the use of lands and proceeded to conclude an agreement with the nisga ' a . 
the treaty and the agreement will be adjusted to the establishment , through negotiation or through litigation , of gitxsan and gitanyow rights . 
nothing is shut off ; nothing is closed out . 
those rights and the status quo are preserved . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
how can the government reconcile this pathetic generosity after having clamped down on the two claiming nations ? 
how can the government reconcile those two statements ? 
one is an absolute contradiction of the other . 
as senator andreychuk suggested , why not include in this agreement compulsory arbitration or some form of mediation , even a dispute settlement mechanism , so that a third party can force a claim settlement ? 
i do not pretend to be very knowledgeable of the treaty itself , but i have listened to and read much of the testimony at committee stage . 
i am troubled by some of the spokesmen for the two claimants stating that , perhaps , more than words will take place to assert their rights . 
that may be an empty threat and it may be theatrics , but the fact that it is on the record should be enough to make us pause and think of the impact , should that happen . 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , i appreciate the observation of senator lynch - staunton . 
i should like to point out , however , that under the nisga ' a final agreement , should claims be established through litigation , in particular , through negotiation with both the gitxsan and the gitanyow , the nisga ' a will be entitled to compensation . 
they have very little to lose . 
if they are prepared , through negotiation with the gitxsan and the gitanyow , to make adjustments to the current terms of the agreement , the nisga ' a will not lose anything of value . 
they will get compensation in other terms of value . 
they should not be accused of not being willing to proceed to negotiate in good faith with the gitxsan and the gitanyow once this agreement is terminated . 
they have every reason to want to live in harmony with their neighbours . 
they also have every reason to go ahead with their own political , economic and social development , and not be held up by neighbours who are neither prepared to come to the table , which is the case with the gitxsan , nor prepared to move quickly , as is the case with the gitanyow . 
i wish to remind all honourable senators that we are in the twentieth year of negotiations and the tenth year since the rules with respect to boundaries were established in 1991 . 
the nisga ' a have been a very patient people . 
they have been at this particular process of negotiation for a very long time . 
i want to say - and i will probably have to say it again and again - that the gitxsan and the gitanyow are not compromised in law . 
i believe that the nisga ' a will continue to hold discussions with those tribal communities , the gitxsan and the gitanyow , in the hope that there will be a settlement . 
this is not an unusual situation , as was pointed out to us by senator christensen . 
in the yukon , it took two to three years after the yukon final agreements were signed , for some participants to settle boundary claims with other yukon aboriginal communities . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
i will not prolong this discussion because i will have a chance to enter the debate later . 
however , i congratulate the nisga ' a . 
they are winners on both counts . 
if their position is maintained , then it is maintained and the claims are rejected . 
if they lose , then they are compensated . 
what a position to be in . 
the point is that if it happened in the yukon and it is happening here , why at the same time be so adamant in saying , " do not let it happen again ? " 
that is the point of the question . 
obviously , it is an admission that not having a solution to the overlap problem is wrong . 
do not try to convince us that , because negotiations have been going on for 20 years , we should give up . 
in the conclusion of the report , the committee indicates that any future agreement should ensure that any overlapping problems will be resolved first . 
honourable senators , i repeat my first question : 
why not impose that principle on this agreement and set a principle which must be followed in future agreements ? 
i am going beyond my knowledge of these negotiations , but i can see future negotiation with overlap problems and someone waving the nisga ' a agreement and saying , " you allowed these overlap claims not to be resolved before signature . 
in so doing , you set a precedent . 
let us do it again . " 
this committee observation will then be meaningless . 
in fact , you have proven by what you said that it is meaningless . 
senator austin : 
the honourable senator is off base . 
upon reading the entire observation , he will see that the establishment of the entitlement to include the nisga ' a agreement is referred to in the first part of the observation , and all else flows from that . 
his interpretation is not correct . 
in any event , i look forward to the debate . 
we have started , and i do not wish to deprive any of my colleagues in this chamber of the novelty of putting forth their arguments and defending those arguments later on . 
much of what i expected to hear from honourable senators is coming out in this question period . 
i think you are being unfair to yourselves . 
senator lynch - staunton : 
i am simply quoting to the honourable senator the words of his committee , which recognizes that the parties have attempted to address this question by including provisions in the nisga ' a final agreement that aim to preserve and protect the rights of aboriginal peoples other than the members of nisga ' a nation . 
your committee is , nevertheless , " deeply concerned about the implications of outstanding overlap issues not only in relation to the nisga ' a and neighbouring first nations but in a broader context . " 
in that statement , you have demonstrated deep unease at the fact that this issue is not resolved . 
if you had put that in front of the nisga ' a and the other two nations , i am sure the privileged ones in this treaty might be more anxious to have the claims resolved . 
as it is , they have no interest in so doing , and the other two nations are being penalized . 
senator andreychuk : 
is it your understanding - and is it on that basis that you are supporting this legislation - that the federal government must negotiate in good faith with aboriginal peoples ? 
senator austin : 
first , honourable senators , i would be astonished if i used the words " sincere " or " insincere " in what i had to say , but the record will show if i did . 
if i accused anyone on that side of being insincere , i certainly did not intend to do so , and i apologize . 
i did use the word " novel " , and i do not believe that that is a derogatory reference in any way . 
as to the outstanding portion of the honourable senator ' s question , i shall stand down from replying for the time being . 
i would like to hear the full arguments of all my colleagues opposite . 
following that , i would be pleased to ask questions of those who enter the debate on that side , or on our side , because i think very soon it should be my turn to ask questions . 
hon. anne c . cools : 
honourable senators , when senator austin was responding to senator comeau ' s question , he read into the record some extracts from a document . 
would senator austin table that document , in order for all of us to have a copy of it ? 
the hon. the speaker : 
honourable senators , leave must be granted for the tabling of documents . 
is leave granted ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
the hon. the speaker : 
leave is granted . 
hon. no ë l a . kinsella ( deputy leader of the opposition ) : 
honourable senators , i wish to thank senator austin for agreeing to reply to my question on whether the committee canvassed the " repealability " of this bill . 
when we suspended last thursday , at senator austin ' s request , some of us did give him a heads - up on the kinds of questions we were interested in exploring . 
i should like to explore , as i mentioned to him last thursday , whether the committee examined the international treaty obligations that canada has assumed . 
for example , we are bound by international treaty obligations pursuant to the united nations international covenant on civil and political rights , as well as the obligation under the first option of protocol to that international covenant . 
i mention that one in particular because of my experience in assisting native women in canada in filing their communication against canada a number of years ago because of the oldsection 12.1 ( b ) of the indian act , which , as honourable senator austin will recall , was found by the united nations human rights committee to be in breach of covenant obligations . 
at that time , then prime minister trudeau accepted the judgment of the united nations , which was made after the supreme court canada had found the sex discrimination in the indian act to be okay and not offensive to the bill of rights . 
prime minister trudeau then caused work to be commenced for the preparation of what was ultimately bill c - 31 . 
that bill was introduced into parliament and was adopted . 
it struck down the rights - denying provision . 
thus , the question of the international treaty obligation is very important and we need to understand it . 
as such , did your committee look at whether parliament will be able to do anything about treaty offences or non - compliance with treaty obligations as a result of things that may occur on the nisga ' a land ? 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , the committee did not hear evidence on the subject of the question that senator kinsella has just addressed . 
however , i shall be very pleased to discuss the question with officials of the department of indian affairs and provide senator kinsella with the best answer i can give . 
senator kinsella : 
i thank the honourable senator for that and , in fairness to him , i shall develop my own thinking . 
your committee did not examine it . 
when i participate in the debate at third reading , i shall examine it . 
with reference to the " repealability " , it would be helpful to have that answer before i participate at third reading . 
one final question . 
the war measures act was replaced by the emergency measures legislation , and that legislation is recognized by international human rights treaties . 
in other words , there are times when the life of a nation is threatened or there are emergencies and , as such , the rights and powers of subsidiary governments must be derogated . 
did your committee look at the application of the emergency measures legislation and its application to the nisga ' a land ? 
hence , there are controls that were not in place with the war measures act . 
does the derogation of rights and powers apply to the nisga ' a land by virtue of the emergency measures legislation ? 
senator austin : 
here again , honourable senators , the matter was not raised in the evidence before the committee , but i shall be pleased to examine that question with government officials and to try to provide senator kinsella with a response . 
senator comeau : 
honourable senators , i have a question with respect to " repealability " , and i raise that question in light of some of the concerns regarding the role of the senate as raised in the clarity bill , which is also before us . 
my understanding of the nisga ' a treaty is that any amendment to that treaty must involve the three parties , the nisga ' a , the legislature of british columbia and the federal cabinet . 
why did it not follow the same trend as in british columbia , where the legislature was to be involved in any amendments ? 
why was the parliament of canada excluded from the amendments of the nisga ' a treaty ? 
why was it left in the hands of cabinet , rather than parliament ? 
senator austin : 
i am not sure that the honourable senator ' s question is correctly based . 
there are a number of ways to make changes to the agreement . 
there are , however , provisions for change within the nisga ' a final agreement that do not require legislation . 
they require the agreement of the parties . 
i will study the honourable senator ' s question in an attempt to provide him with a more full answer . 
hon. g é rald - a . 
in reference to senator murray ' s question on the division of power , reference was made to the application of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms . 
can it not be considered in the answer that section 31 of the charter says that nothing in this charter extends the legislative powers of anyone or authority ? 
section 25 of the charter says , on the other hand , that the guarantee in this charter of certain rights and freedoms should not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal treaty or other rights and freedoms . 
section 35 , as we know , is not in the charter - it is outside the charter . 
therefore , i wonder if it might be possible for senator austin , in his reply , to refer to the effect of section 25 and section 31 . 
senator austin : 
thank you , senator beaudoin . 
i will endeavour to do so . 
hon. jerahmiel s . grafstein : 
honourable senators , i have a supplemental question arising out of senator kinsella ' s question . 
it is one of the issues that troubled me as i reviewed the evidence of the committee after the hearings . 
perhaps i could put that same question in another way , because senator austin is already on notice that he will respond . 
senator austin : 
i will take that variation on the question under consideration and endeavour to respond to it . 
the hon. the speaker : 
if there are no further questions or comments , we are prepared , then , to proceed to further debate at third reading . 
i must give warning to the senate , particularly to honourable senator austin , who has referred several times to closing the debate . 
under rule 35 , there is no closing of debate at third reading . 
of course the senate is free by leave to do as it wishes , but under rule 35 , there is no provision for closing debate at third reading . 
senator st. germain : 
saved by the bell . 
honourable senators , first , i should like to recognize the fact that today we have in the gallery the leaders and representatives of the nisga ' a nation . 
i think it is important that we recognize them , the hard work that they have put in to get to this stage of their negotiations , and the way they followed the proceedings and worked to try to respond to all the questions that were put to them during the course of each of the studies that has taken place . 
we have arrived at a critical time in the history ofbritish columbia and our dealings with our aboriginal peoples . 
those of us from british columbia , like senators austin , perrault , and myself , know full well that we must make progress in this particular area . 
expectations are extremely high in british columbia that what we do here will be the right thing , the correct thing , and that it will bring finality to the issue . 
i thank the members of the standing senate committee on aboriginal peoples for their serious examination of this legislation . 
i also thank senators sparrow , grafstein , beaudoin , joyal , lawson , wilson , comeau and nolin for their interest and attention to the issue of british columbians . 
senator austin , as chair , had a difficult task . 
in retrospect , we should have travelled . 
we should have gone to listen to the man or woman on the street . 
it was decided that we would not do that , but i believe it was important . 
we are at third reading stage now , but i wanted to mention that in passing as a reflection of some of the evidence brought before the committee . 
these agreements must take place . 
as stated before , politically my party is in agreement with the intent of the deal . 
however , in my review of this agreement , and in the studies that we have done , i am struck with the realization that only three groups really want this deal as written . 
i stand to be corrected on this . 
the majority of the nisga ' a , those who voted , accepted this deal through the ratification process . 
the federal and provincial governments want this deal . 
however , in spite of all polling , i believe that fewer than 50 per cent of british columbians really understand the deal and want it . 
that is a major concern , and it must be a concern to all of us . 
i believe we have a responsibility not only to pass legislation but to ensure that people on the street understand what is being done . 
it is not a case of government doing things to people but doing things for people . 
my understanding is that the tsimshian and tahltan nations , both neighbours of the nisga ' a , signed agreements with the nisga ' a , but their traditional lands and aborignal rights were marginally infringed upon . 
they apparently are still negotiating with the nisga ' a in regard to their differences . 
the 2,000 house members of the gitanyow and the 10,000 house members of the gitxsan nations are opposed to this specific agreement . 
why ? 
as has been mentioned , it is because their rights will be severely impacted . 
this has been mentioned during the questioning of senator austin . 
honourable senators , i have a great deal of concern about several aspects of this bill . 
there is the constitutional aspect , accountability , minority rights , women ' s rights , the fisheries , et cetera . 
i have never received a full answer to the question of why this is a constitutional agreement as opposed to a delegated agreement . 
are all the other issues , as i asked senator austin today , in jeopardy ? 
what is wrong with them ? 
if nothing else , why was this deal done differently ? 
will we will have to change the others into the type of self - government authority legislation that the nisga ' a agreement creates ? 
as i pointed out in my questioning on the sahtu , gwich ' in , sechelt and yukon , some of those agreements were reached by the previous government and some have been concluded by the present government . 
i hope that those agreements are not in jeopardy . 
senator austin has said they are not . 
if they are not , why did we not continue the way we proceeded in the past ? 
i have travelled to the gitanyow , nisga ' a and gitxsan lands and have spent time with the people . 
it is not a question of me reading the newspaper or transcripts . 
i have been face to face with these people . 
i have listened to them and spoken with them . 
i gather i can use a book , even though we are not supposed to use props . 
to give an analogy , the original claim of the nisga ' a was about the size of my fist . 
there is some debate , but it has been explained to me that the calder claim in the 1970 s was done without prejudice , referring to the boundaries therein . 
the 1913 resolution included the kinskuch river , which is considered to be one of the boundaries . 
the 1913 resolution went further than the calder boundaries . 
the final boundaries that were agreed upon delineated an area the size of both my fists . 
what is of great concern to me are the fee simple properties that were granted to the nisga ' a within the areas in dispute . 
we are placing the gitanyow and gitxsan in an untenable position , honourable senators . 
we know that the calder decision was instrumental in forcing the federal government to create the 1973 comprehensive claims settlement process , which did not adequately address self - governance . 
we know that the 1980 - 82 patriation of our constitution recognized the rights of our peoples within it . 
we also know that self - governance was not defined or specifically included at that time , nor later . 
we know that during the 1980 s and early 1990 s the government dealt with the issue in the only manner available without amending the constitution , even though the charlottetown accord exercise established a solution to recognize self - government for aboriginals within canada . 
we also know the advice and instruction from the supreme court that arose from sparrow - the musqueam - in 1990 and delgamuukw - the gitxsan - in 1997 . 
that , then , is really the modern day starting point for our land claims and treaty rights . 
this is the background context for these negotiations and agreements . 
if we look at this history further , honourable senators , we see that latter day nisga ' a negotiations started in 1976 because of the calder decision . 
in fact , we know that the gitanyow filed to commence their negotiations first in 1976 , but the government would not put them first in the line . 
the filing of the gitanyow was accepted in 1977 . 
these two groups effectively commenced their respective processes at the same time . 
we also know that the gitxsan submitted their claim in 1979 . 
canada signed framework agreements with the nisga ' a in 1989 and again in 1991 . 
in the late 1980 s , the gitanyow and the gitxsan commenced the research that would determine where the boundaries of their traditional lands should be drawn . 
this work was concluded in 1995 . 
there was a shift in population in the late 1800 s , driven by missionaries . 
however , the eight houses of the gitanyow were never relinquished and their land was never abandoned . 
there was a migration due to the economies of scale at that time in this area , as well as due to missionary direction and , i presume , attempted assimilation . 
however , never did the gitanyow relinquish rights to the eight houses that are configured in pieces of land . 
the gitanyow had to wait . 
at the heart of these agreements was the agreement of the nisga ' a that their land boundary with the gitanyow was at the mouth of the kinskuch river , a very important boundary . 
with the exception of a couple of small true overlapping claims , these two groups agreed upon ownership of the land and upon where the boundaries lay . 
therefore , the gitanyow were not overly worried or too aggressive about the land claims process . 
they were satisfied with the boundaries that had been established . 
it was through the pre - aip consultations of 1992 to 1995 that the gitanyow accelerated their efforts , resulting in the signing of their framework agreement in 1996 with the b.c. treaty commission , the same year the nisga ' a signed their aip . 
the gitanyow quickly learned that up to 85 per cent of their traditional lands were being claimed by the nisga ' a . 
during 1996 to 1998 , the nisga ' a held their post - aip consultations , resulting in the signing of the nisga ' a final agreement in 1998 . frustrated with the governments ' continuing lack of good faith and negotiations to settle land boundaries , the gitxsan sued the governments and won under delgamuukw . 
with the governments ' persistent ignorance of the gitanyow ' s requests to negotiate in good faith the overlap issues with the nisga ' a , the gitanyow were once again forced to appeal to the courts for instruction . 
that was the luuxhon case . 
honourable senators , bill c - 9 infringes upon the rights of several aboriginal groups . 
it is the gitanyow and the gitxsan who are fighting for their rights . 
the federal government has told these groups that it will not renegotiate any terms of the nisga ' a final agreement and that overlap issues will be dealt with after the nisga ' a final agreement and through the processes set out within the nisga ' a final agreement . 
the minister admitted in committee that the government chose to proceed with the nisga ' a and accepted their information on traditional lands over that of the other groups . 
the courts have urged aboriginal peoples to negotiate settlements to overlap issues among themselves . 
the minister chose the nisga ' a over the gitanyow and the gitxsan . 
it is as simple as that . 
he said that he did . 
the minister and the government have a fiduciary responsibility to all aboriginal peoples . 
i do not believe that the government can take sides . 
however , by its own admission , it has . 
the nisga ' a have done an excellent job of negotiating on behalf of their people . 
they asked for a huge tract of land , and they have received it . 
the federal and provincial governments wanted anything that would achieve what some describe as " political objectives . " 
that is what was said in committee . 
after 27 years , the government can say that they have resolved the nisga ' a claims for aboriginal rights . 
however , if this process continues as it has , it will be done on the backs of all the other aboriginal groups in the area - mainly the gitanyow and the gitxsan . 
the gitanyow and gitxsan have no financial resources with which to fight for their rights . 
i asked the minister in committee whether he was prepared to fund them . 
he did not answer the question . 
the government advanced funds for the nisga ' a negotiations by way of loans and legal counsel but the government has basically said that it will not pay for gitanyow and gitxsan counsel . 
the government has said , " we are right and everyone else is wrong ; if you do not like the results , you can go to court . " 
the government , through its own actions , provided a whole new definition for what appears to be a slight degree of arrogance . 
honourable senators , the nisga ' a worked hard for a deal and they should get a deal . 
they want a deal and they deserve one . 
as honourable senators know , the purpose of this place is to examine and revise legislation , investigate national issues , and represent regional , provincial and minority interests . 
this has never changed . 
this is our responsibility as senators . 
our instructions are to make laws for the peace , order and good government of canada . 
we are not to be coerced in any way , shape or form to ratify what is not in the best interests of all canadians . 
does this bill deserve to be passed into law ? 
i believe that there may be flaws in bill c - 9 and in the nisga ' a final agreement which must be remedied . 
however , the flaws are not only in the agreement but also in the process . 
chief joe gosnell said that it is not a perfect agreement . 
we all know that the federal government , at least , established a policy to deal with the land claims and treaty agreements . 
i wanted to discuss amendments at the committee , but senators were told by the chairman that amendments would not be accepted and that they should be proposed in the senate at third reading . 
instead , it was proposed that advice be put to the government pertaining to the future treaties where overlap treaty rights were in conflict and that they would be resolved through mediation and arbitration . 
the observation questioned by senators andreychuk and lynch - staunton and reported to this chamber at report stage is an admission - and i agree with senator lynch - staunton , senator andreychuk and others who have questioned senator austin on this point - that of what i speak today is correct and should be dealt with before ratification and royal assent . 
that observation , inasmuch as others may want to tie it into this and that , is an admission that the b.c. treaty commission produced a document stating that no treaties would be signed or entered into at one stage and then later changed its position , clearly stating that all overlaps should be resolved prior to entering into any agreements or treaties . 
honourable senators , i will provide this chamber with a quote that was uttered by an honourable gentleman in relation to another agreement before the house of commons . 
onmay 25 , 1993 , minister robert nault is reported in hansard at page 19537 as stating : 
what members of this side of the house have tried to relate to their constituents and all canadians is that we as a house of commons , as parliamentarians who represent the people , should not be so quick to ram this agreement through the house . 
why mr. nault has lost his passion to protect the people now , when he had asked for this in 1993 , is hard to understand . 
it is important that canada ' s first nations have an unencumbered land base . 
the nisga ' a final agreement pits native against native . 
supporters of this agreement tried to dismiss this as nothing . 
surely , honourable senators will understand that a people whose livelihoods and existence depend upon the ability to harvest natural resources needs a land base . 
however , it is not just any land base . 
it must be a land base with which they are familiar , where they have lived for hundreds of years ; a land base they can , without any dispute , call their own . 
that is why it is so very wrong for the governments of canada and british columbia to have negotiated a settlement with the nisga ' a that includes lands claimed by the gitanyow and gitxsan first nations people . 
the government ' s answer , when we raised the inequities of the situation with the minister in committee , was that the ultimate settlement of the disputed land ownership claims is provided for in the nisga ' a agreement in sections 33 , 34 and 35 , as referred to by senator austin . 
if it is found that the lands included as nisga ' a lands are found to be traditional lands of the gitxsan and gitanyow people , then the nisga ' a are to be equitably compensated for losing land to which they never actually had governing rights . 
to clarify that , i fully understand , as the counsel for the nisga ' a have explained to me and to others on the committee , that if they have no rights to the land , they will not be compensated . 
if they have rights to the land and other people also have rights to the land , i believe the nisga ' a can be compensated . 
that is a direct version of the compensation in sections 33 , 34 and 35 . 
what about the gitxsan and gitanyow ? 
they get back what rightly belonged to them , but are they compensated for the trouble and expense they went through to reclaim their lands ? 
they have to go through the courts . 
how else would they do it , unless there is another solution about which we are not aware ? 
the method by which the government of canada has dealt with the overlapping land issue has been the subject of judicial commentary already . 
the gitanyow alleged that because the governments entered an agreement in principle with the nisga ' a - now the nisga ' a final agreement that is before us today - the governments have fettered their discretion to bargain in good faith with the gitanyow . 
the governments abandoned their negotiations with the gitanyow and gitxsan that had been going on at the same time as the nisga ' a negotiations . 
as we learned from the minister of indian affairs and northern development , he and the government chose sides in the land dispute and went on to enter into an agreement with the nisga ' a . 
the point being made in the lawsuit is that if there is a duty to negotiate in good faith with the gitxsan and the gitanyow , the government could not choose sides in the land ownership dispute . 
the gitanyow allege that by this nisga ' a agreement their aboriginal title to land in the nass valley has been violated . 
when the lawsuit began , the governments of canada and british columbia brought a preliminary motion to strike out the gitanyow statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action . 
the court held that the statement of claim was valid as it related to the issue of the two governments making it impossible to bargain in good faith because they had already reached agreement with the nisga ' a . 
the judge held that , arguably , the duty owed by the governments is to " conduct treaty negotiations in good faith and in a manner which will take into account all aboriginal nations which have a claim in a specific area . " 
this , i submit , was not done in the case of the nisga ' a , gitanyow and gitxsan . 
the judge in this case , the luuxhon case , and the famous delgamuukw case made it clear that the courts would prefer that all outstanding claims to land ownership were to be settled among the parties without resorting to litigation . 
when this case eventually went to trial , mr. justice williamson of the b.c. supreme court had to determine whether there was a duty of the governments to negotiate in good faith a treaty with the gitanyow . 
he wrote : 
while there is a moral obligation - 
- so canada argued - 
- there is no legal obligation to negotiate in good faith . 
this is the position of the government of canada in relation to the land claims negotiation with the aboriginal neighbours of the nisga ' a . 
when the government chooses sides , it shows no mercy . 
i conclude that the duty to negotiate in good faith , founded upon the fiduciary relationship between aboriginal people and the crown , applies equally to the crown in right of canada and the crown in right of british columbia . 
he went on to define the duty at paragraph 74 , stating : 
in general terms , that duty must include at least the absence of any appearance of " sharp dealings " , disclosure of relevant factors , and negotiation " without oblique motive " . 
honourable senators should know that the crown is appealing this decision , unfortunately . 
when one aboriginal nation must use the courts to define the duty to negotiate owed by the federal government in relation to land claims , we are in a sorry state . 
that is why i believe that all outstanding land ownership issues must be settled before a settlement offer is concluded . 
senator austin : 
is the honourable senator referring to the whole province of british columbia ? 
senator st. germain : 
certainly , all outstanding land ownership issues as far as overlaps must be settled . 
senator austin : 
senator st. germain : 
the only avenue left for the gitxsan and gitanyow is the courts . 
why force them to go to court when the remedy is so simple ? 
we could wait and have them settle this amongst themselves . 
just wait on bill c - 9 . 
that will make the parties focus quickly . 
we cannot continue to deal with canada ' s aboriginal people in this way . 
we must ensure fairness . 
the government will not follow a doctrine of fairness , therefore , it is left to us in the senate to impose one . 
if we are prudent , we should obtain an advance ruling before we make a move , get a solution on the overlaps , then decide on the legislation . 
there may be a delay , however , our mandate compels us to do our due diligence . 
honourable senators , that is our duty to this chamber , to parliament , to the people of canada , and certainly to the people our decisions will most deeply affect - the people of british columbia and the people of the nass river valley . 
if we do not proceed with prudence , then the settlement of native claims will be set back for at least as long as it took this issue to get to this point . 
i do not believe that is the solution . 
i predict few settlements being reached while the nisga ' a agreement is tied up in the courts . 
this bill , the agreement , and the treaty do not achieve certainty , finality , clarity or accountability in their entirety . 
this is not an agreement that we can point to as a guide or the template to achieve lasting good faith negotiations of which all canadians can be proud . 
the process in this agreement must be improved . 
the legislation must allow for future improvements when important circumstances warrant . 
honourable senators , let us do the right thing . 
let us facilitate the parties moving to the negotiating table . 
the parties have the ability and the focus to determine the equitable solution . 
it is then and only then that we can be satisfied with honouring treaty rights in the legislation . 
this , honourable senators , is such an important issue and will have such a negative impact on all groups where overlaps exist . 
both the gitanyow and the gitxsan have agreed on an arbitrated settlement if given the chance . 
this may not settle the constitutional aspects or other aspects , but my main concern personally is the overlap . 
it definitely goes a long way to negotiating aboriginal rights , i believe , if we go that route . 
remember , it is one of our chief justices who said that " we are all here to stay . " 
motion in amendment 
hon. gerry st. germain : 
honourable senators , in the spirit of prudence and satisfaction , so that we can have certainty and finality , and in order to give the government the opportunity to consider requesting a reference from the supreme court of canada on the constitutionality of the jurisdictional issues , including paramountcy or whatever is set out in the nisga ' a final agreement , but mainly because of the overlap , i move , seconded by senator andreychuk : 
that bill c - 9 , an act to give effect to the nisga ' a final agreement , be not now read a third time , but that it be read a third time this day six months hence . 
some hon. senators : 
hear , hear ! 
the hon. the speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. senators : 
agreed . 
some hon. senators : 
no. 
the hon. the speaker : 
those in favour of the motion will please say " yea " . 
hon. jerahmiel s . grafstein : 
honourable senators , i thought we might have an opportunity to explore this interesting turn of events for a moment or two , if we might . 
i listened with care to the honourable senator st. germain ' s exposition . 
i find it a little complex and a little confusing , in the sense that on the one hand he seems to attack the governance pillar and on the other hand leaves the land claims pillar alone . 
the honourable senator then attacks the land claims pillar by saying that the overlap makes it impossible to deal with the land claims issue . 
it strikes me that that puts us in a more intense state of stasis than the honourable senator suggested the government was doing . 
i want to deal with the honourable senator ' s solution to all this , which is to now say to all of us here to abrogate our own responsibilities and not vote on this matter until the courts - notwithstanding the fact that most of us here believe that parliament is supreme - clean up our messy handiwork . 
is that the honourable senator ' s position ? 
senator st. germain : 
definitely not . 
i thank honourable senator grafstein for his question . 
if anything , turning to the courts should be the last course of action . 
what i have said is that the gitxsan and the gitanyow have both said that they would agree to binding arbitration if they were allowed to present their case , their history , regarding their land claims . 
that is the route that i recommend . 
it is for that reason that i moved that there be a six - month hold on the bill , so that these people can go to arbitration on the overlap issues , on the lands that are overlapped by the nisga ' a agreement on the gitanyow and gitxsan . 
honourable senators , i may have misstated something in my speech , however , there is no way that i meant to suggest litigation . 
one of the most debilitating and sad parts of this whole process is that we are forcing these people into litigation and into the courts if we allow this to proceed immediately . 
it is for that reason that i suggest strongly that the only course of action at this stage is to an arbitrator , which both sides that are afflicted have said they would accept . 
senator grafstein : 
honourable senators , my confusion increases , but that may not be the fault of the honourable senator opposite , it may be my limited ability to understand what he is saying . 
as i understood the evidence , i did not hear either the gitxsan or the gitanyow say that they were prepared to go to binding arbitration for these overlapping claims . 
as a matter of fact , what i heard is that they did not object to this treaty or to this piece of legislation . 
that surprised me because the senator knows my concerns about this bill . 
i remain confused by the position of the honourable senator . 
senator st. germain : 
i am more confused by the question , honourable senators . 
the fact remains that i respect the position of senator grafstein , and i think the honourable senator put excellent points forward during the deliberations . 
this is not a question of opposition going back and forth , it is a question of clarification . 
as i said , if the honourable senator misunderstood what i said , there is no way in the world that i would ever suggest litigation . 
i have never been in litigation in my own business life , and it would be the last thing that i would ever suggest to anyone else . 
i say to the honourable senator that i believe the gitxsan were asked a question in the committee in regard to arbitration . 
elmer derrick , who was representing the gitxsan , clearly stated that he was prepared to accept the decision of an arbitrator . 
whether or not the honourable senator could be correct on this , i spoke to the representatives of the gitanyow and asked them emphatically the question : 
they said they would . 
however , honourable senators , whether , in fact , that was actually in committee or not , i am not certain . 
hon. jack austin : 
i believe that senator st. germain will recall that minister nault made it absolutely clear that he would not contemplate a recommendation to the governor in council with respect to a reference to the supreme court of canada . 
i believe that the honourable senator , having participated actively in the evidence given by the nisga ' a tribal council , will recall that they want to stand with the agreement as it is and that they have no intention of arbitrating the claims . 
i have the same recollection as senator grafstein . 
i did not hear the gitanyow or the gitxsan make an unconditional offer to arbitrate , not that that would have affected the points i have just made . 
they said : " oh yes , we would be prepared to arbitrate . " 
however , senator st. germain has not chosen an arbitrator , there is no process of arbitration and no question framed . 
what he wants to do is to stall and delay this particular agreement . 
in other words , as far as the judge is concerned , the proposed legislation raises moot questions . 
he wants an actual piece of legislation before him . 
what the honourable senator is proposing is an amendment which is designed , effectively , to wreck the bill , to destroy the process of treaty negotiations in the province of british columbia , to arm those who have no intention of ever seeing section 35 aboriginal rights in the area of self - government ever established , and who do not want section 35 constitutional protection but rather delegated power , power that can be pulled up and down or pulled away at any time . 
it is entirely contrary to the spirit of the legislation and the public policy requirements in aboriginal affairs with the province of british columbia . 
senator st. germain : 
honourable senators , the arbitration act of the province of british columbia would provide all the guidance . 
during discussions in committee , the question was asked about who would be the arbitrator . 
the witnesses assumed that it would be another white person . 
i said : " no , it does not have to be a white person . 
we could name aboriginal persons to chair the board of arbitration and to serve as members on the board . " 
i would say the honourable senator ' s statements in this regard are a red herring . 
if they do have the certainty required , i do not see them as being any different from the nisga ' a or any other native bands or groups in our country . 
aboriginals are aboriginals . 
if one has a constitutionalized type of authority , they should all have it . 
if some have delegated authority , why is there the difference ? 
that is the question we continually ask . 
it does not seem that we will ever receive the answer . 
as far as the b.c. liberals are concerned , the honourable senator has as many friends in that gang as i do , and perhaps more . 
as far as i am concerned , i am asking for this delay because the government may send a reference to the supreme court , and perhaps they will not . 
the fact is , i am asking for the time to force the natives back to the table to negotiate the overlap situation . 
as i said earlier , honourable senators , let us delve into this subject . 
we are discussing a huge block of land . 
in the negotiations , the nisga ' a were given rights to gitanyow territory , to five fee simple pieces of land to the tune of a couple of hundred hectares as well as one island on kwinageese lake , which was part of the gitxsan territory and the delgamuukw designated area within the gitxsan area . 
the honourable senator says that the bargaining was done in good faith and that we could have changed it when fee simple land that was in dispute was given out . 
this is the subject i would like to see brought to the fore . 
i have been consistent on the issue of overlap . 
the worst thing we could do is pit natives against natives and to tell them the only way they will be able to defend their property is on the ground . 
honourable senators know what that means . 
i have said to the honourable senator before the committee that we are possibly creating another palestinian - israeli situation in regard to land battles . 
that analogy may be extreme , but there is a possibility . 
we have had problems up there before . 
senator austin : 
honourable senators , i do not doubt the honourable senator ' s sincerity . 
he has actively pursued the interests of the gitxsan and gitanyow throughout the evidence . 
he has focused on their concerns . 
the gitxsan and the gitanyow have had years to reach a conclusion with the nisga ' a . 
negotiating with the gitanyow continues to be a possibility , as both they and the minister acknowledged in the evidence . 
the nisga ' a have no intention of submitting these overlapping claims to arbitration . 
they have an intention to continue the negotiations once the bill is passed . 
the honourable senator ' s amendment is completely without useful effect . 
i would never advise the nisga ' a to accept the amendment of the honourable senator . 
this bargain was struck in good faith between the government of british columbia , the government of canada and the nisga ' a . 
if it is to be changed through negotiations , it must be with the willing participation of the nisga ' a ; otherwise , it will be changed through the litigation process , which the honourable senator deplores , and i would not be happy to see it take place . 
i believe that this amendment would destroy the very objective the honourable senator is seeking . 
the nisga ' a will not be forced into arbitration and the government of canada and the government of british columbia will not force them into arbitration . 
the nisga ' a will , of their own free will and good judgment , have further talks with the gitxsan and the gitanyow if there is no undue pressure . 
again , i believe the honourable senator ' s proposed amendment is harmful to aboriginal relations in british columbia . 
some hon. senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senator st. germain : 
i find that very surprising . 
the hon. the speaker : 
honourable senator st. germain , i wish to point out that there is one minute left in your 45 - minute speaking period . 
senator st. germain : 
honourable senators , i know the nisga ' a will not relinquish what they have , once they have this final agreement . 
in any dispute like this , when somebody is put into a preferential position , whether by government or someone else , there is no incentive to negotiate ? 
it does not make sense . 
if they would not negotiate before , why in god ' s name would they negotiate later ? 
that is what we are saying . 
the honourable senator says the nisga ' a will not go to arbitration . 
i do not blame them . 
they might lose in arbitration because of the oral history and the totem poles . 
if the gitanyow are prepared to subject themselves to the decision of an arbitrator , i cannot think of anything more fair . 
that would remove the possibility of litigation . 
senator grafstein cannot understand me and i cannot understand the honourable senator austin on this position . 
perhaps we should all sit down around the table and try to figure this out . 
this just does not make sense . 
the hon. the speaker : 
honourable senator st. germain , your speaking time has expired . 
are you seeking leave to continue ? 
senator st. germain : 
honourable senators , i seek leave to continue . 
the hon. the speaker : 
honourable senators , is leave granted ? 
hon. dan hays ( deputy leader of the government ) : 
i propose that we extend the time for another 15 minutes . 
the hon. the speaker : 
is it agreed , honourable senators , that we extend the time for a further 15 minutes ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
senator st. germain : 
i thank honourable senators for their indulgence . 
senator austin : 
could i just say that the nisga ' a will not arbitrate , nor should they . 
the amendment is a total nullity . 
it will have no beneficial effect . 
i propose that the honourable senator st. germain withdraw it . 
senator st. germain : 
honourable senators , i will not withdraw my amendment . 
when we asked the minister whether he would fund these people to defend their land claim , he did not respond . 
therefore , i ask the honourable senator whether the minister will fund them . 
how can they go to litigation if they have no money ? 
senator austin : 
i am sponsoring the bill , but i do not speak for the government . 
i have no idea what they will do in terms of funding litigation for any aboriginal community . 
senator hays : 
honourable senators , if we are at the end of questions and comments , it is obvious that other senators wish to speak to this amendment . 
my understanding is that the honourable senator austin would move adjournment of the debate . 
senator beaudoin may also wish to speak . 
hon. g é rald - a . 
honourable senators , i wanted to move the adjournment of the debate . 
senator hays : 
why do we not follow the practice of alternating speakers ? 
if there is no first speaker here in response , then we would agree to you going next , senator beaudoin . 
on motion of senator austin , debate adjourned . 
in the quebec secession reference 
second reading - debate continued 
on the order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the honourable senator boudreau , p . c . , seconded by the honourable senator hays , for the second reading of bill c - 20 , to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the supreme court of canada in the quebec secession reference . 
hon. no ë l a . kinsella ( deputy leader of the opposition ) : 
honourable senators , rarely during the past 133 - year history of the senate of canada have we been called upon to examine a more dangerous legislative proposal than bill c - 20 . the danger of this bill is twofold . 
first , it speaks to the matter of the secession of a province from canada . 
second , honourable senators are being called upon to give the consent of this house to a historical reduction of the voice of this upper chamber of the bicameral parliament of canada . 
honourable senators , on the first matter , and in the words of the second preambular paragraph of the bill before us : 
whereas any proposal relating to the break - up of a democratic state is a matter of the utmost gravity and is of fundamental importance to all of its citizens ; 
honourable senators , given that these words speak to the breakup of canada , it is surely axiomatic , if anything is axiomatic , that the senate of canada is being called upon to analyze and give an in - depth reflection to a legislative proposal that touches on a matter of the utmost gravity . 
honourable senators , the record of our study and sober second thought will be a record of the value of the senate in our bicameral system of parliament . 
yes , hansard will demonstrate the thoughtful , acute and in - depth analysis which this second house of parliament will have given to a proposal which addresses the survival of canada as a unified country . 
on the second matter , our debate will be a watershed or a turning point in the history of the senate of canada because this legislative proposal attempts to redefine and restrict the role of the senate here at the beginning of the 21 st century . 
argument has already been advanced concerning a theory of responsible government which , if left unchallenged , would fundamentally alter the manner in which the bicameral parliament of canada itself holds the government or the executive power to account . 
i am confident that all honourable senators shall , in this precedent - setting debate , rise to the challenge and meet this test of history . 
let me turn to the first issue , honourable senators , which is clarity . 
clarity , clearly , is popular . 
it would appear that bill c - 20 itself is very popular across canada . 
at first glance , and if this bill is presented as a so - called " clarity act " , it is indeed very appealing . 
everyone is in favour of clarity . 
to be opposed to clarity on whatever matter would be distinctly anti - intellectual and quite unreasonable . 
however , my analysis of this bill raises many concerns and demonstrates a lack of clarity . 
my study also indicates that there is much to be concerned about as parliament considers whether or not to establish a statutory process and a legal right to secession , for if we do this it will be for the first time in canada ' s 133 - year history . 
the government has successfully led many canadians to believe that bill c - 20 will bring clarity to the process of a province seeking to secede from canada . 
unfortunately , what this bill actually does is to give a false sense of security , to give a facade that everything will be okay , everything will be just fine . 
the bill is a masterpiece of political ambiguity , and it is very difficult to determine if the government of canada knows exactly what its own real goal is with this bill . 
furthermore , honourable senators , i am reminded by w . p . kinsella ' s passage in shoeless joe that " if you build it , they will come and use it . " 
we also recall the dynamic of the self - fulfilling prophesy mechanism which is documented by social scientists . 
therefore , it is of grave concern to me that parliament would , for the first time in our history , erect the stage upon which , if used , would be played out the breakup of canada . 
few federations acknowledge the right of a member state or province to leave , let alone set up the process by which this can be done . 
by setting out the conditions for secession , no matter how stringent , this government might find short - term appeal for this in some parts of canada . 
however , it will at the same time , with this bill , fundamentally damage the real structures holding our country together . 
in his article entitled , " clarity and confusion " , which appears in the february 2000 edition of diplomatic international canada , david jones , a former political minister counsellor at the united states embassy in canada , has written : 
ultimately , there are only two ways to maintain national unity : force or persuasion . 
all in this chamber abjure maintaining national unity by force . 
rather , canadians have always and must continue to rely on persuasion . 
my first approach to the bill was to recognize that its proponents claim that it rests on the advisory opinion of the supreme court of canada . 
the question that , therefore , presents itself is whether there are fault lines in that advisory opinion . 
indeed , what is the status of an advisory opinion of the supreme court as compared with a judgment of the supreme court ? 
honourable senators , there are several major fault lines in the advisory opinion in the quebec reference case . 
therefore , the bill , to the extent that it is resting on this foundation , is standing on faulty ground . 
as compared with a judgment of the highest court in canada , an advisory opinion of the court is simply that - advisory . 
indeed , the honourable antonio lamer publicly expressed his views on this fact . 
one need not treat this advice with the same degree of acceptance as a decision of the supreme court . 
we should recall , as in the recent marshall case , that the supreme court , after making a decision , can clarify or make changes to an earlier decision . 
in looking at the advisory opinion of the court , consider what is called " reading in . " 
the court was placed in the unenviable position of having to reply to the reference questions submitted to it by the government of canada . 
it is , however , important that we recognize that the court has attempted in this advisory opinion to use that technique of " reading in " to legislation that which is not contained therein . 
many commentators find this type of judicial activism to be dangerous and to be undermining of the functions of the legislative branch in our system of governance . 
honourable senators , if there is a concern with this approach of the court to " read in " provisions not contained in ordinary statutory law , then , mutatis mutandis , there must be a grave concern if the court attempts to " read in " provisions of constitutional law that are not expressly provided in the constitution . 
in other words , the attempt by the court to " read in " to the constitution of canada provisions that are not part of the constitution could be a dangerous attempt at constitutional amendment that bypasses the proper constitutional amendment process . 
our constitutional amendment process is designed to ensure that changes to our fundamental law will occur only after careful federal - provincial steps are followed , steps that involve the various legislatures and parliament . 
constitutional amendments ought not to be allowed to be bypassed by a judicial " reading - in " by the court . 
in this opinion , the court attempts to " read in " to the constitution that a secessionist movement in canada be accorded the right to obligate the rest of canada to negotiate the breakup of canada . 
honourable senators , neither the constitution act of 1867 , the constitution act , 1982 , nor the written and unwritten rules and principles of the constitution provide for such a provision . 
the advice of the court would require " reading in " such a provision . 
a comparative study of this point in constitutions such as those of the united states of america or the republic of france will demonstrate that not only do these constitutions not provide for secession , their respective supreme courts would not be allowed to read in any such provision . 
we might recall from a case in the united states in 1868 , texas v. white , that famous line of the united states supreme court , " the union is indestructible . " 
that brings me to the principle of the divisibility of canada . 
one major fault line in the advisory opinion of the court , and consequently a faulty foundation principle of bill c - 20 , is the assumption that canada is divisible . 
the analysis of the political theory developed by the court on federalism , democracy , constitutionalism and the rule of law led it to develop an opinion which , by implication , accepts the principle that canada is divisible . 
fortunately , the court ' s view is only an opinion . 
consider , honourable senators , that the supreme court of the united states of america and the constitutional court of the united states of mexico , the other two great federations with which canada shares this north american continent , federations in which also the rule of law , democracy and constitutionalism are shared values - these federations do not have the high court nor their respective governments or legislatures accepting the principle that their federations are divisible ; nor should canada . 
where in the advisory opinion of the court is there a call for statutory action ? 
the advisory opinion , to my reading , neither envisages nor suggests that there should be legislation adopted by parliament to give statutory expression to this opinion . 
indeed , the former chief justice expressed surprise that such a step was undertaken by the government . 
furthermore , honourable senators , where is the constitutional authority for this proposed legislation to be introduced here in parliament ? 
the advisory opinion of the court does not indicate any constitutional authority on which to base the legislation that has been introduced by the government . 
as my colleague senator nolin asked of the sponsor of the bill here in the senate : 
parliament has been asked to decide on the possible secession of this country . 
on what constitutional authority is the government relying to introduce such legislation ? 
honourable senators , i ask where in the constitution or where in the parliament of canada act or where in the customs and usages of parliament does the executive or legislative power have the right to bring forward legislative proposals that will facilitate and make legal the breakup of canada ? 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
honourable senators , i am sorry to interrupt the honourable senator but his 15 minutes are up . 
is leave granted for the honourable senator to continue ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
senator kinsella : 
honourable senators , the mandate of parliament is to pass laws that the majority of both houses judge to be in the best interests of canada . 
this bill is obviously not in the best interests of canada because it speaks to the steps to destroy canada . 
even the peace , order and good government provisions of section 91 of the constitution act , 1867 , do not justify the breakup of canada . 
therefore , this bill , in my view , is ultra vires parliament and should not proceed through this house . 
mention has already been made that it is difficult to see the advice of the court on the matter of the amending formula . 
the advisory opinion indicates the need for a constitutional amendment at the end of their envisaged process and one would have expected that the court and the proponent of this bill would have set out the circumstances detailing which of the amending formulae would apply . 
the court does not indicate which amending formula would apply ; nor was the sponsor of the bill in the senate able to tell us when i asked him . 
honourable senators , why introduce this bill ? 
having made the decision to submit the quebec reference to the supreme court for an opinion , and having received that opinion which purports to give a new constitutional right to negotiations to the secessionist movement , what motivated the government to now give the secessionist movement the statutory right to secession ? 
the leader of the government in the senate , who is also the sponsor of this bill , stated in his remarks at second reading : 
the constant threat of a third referendum on quebec secession in less than a generation leaves us no responsible choice but to act now , and before the crisis atmosphere of a referendum campaign . 
the prime minister of canada asked the premier of quebec to agree to a commitment not to hold a referendum in the premier ' s current mandate . 
the premier refused , forcing the government of canada to proceed with this bill . 
honourable senators , the issue raised there is what might be called the " shelf - life " of a referendum result ; that is , for how long is the result of a referendum good ? 
bill c - 20 is completely silent on this matter , notwithstanding the sponsor of the bill in the senate telling us that this was one of the motivations for the bill . 
i turn the attention of honourable senators to why i believe that bill c - 20 facilitates the secessionist movement . 
the proponent of this bill would lead us to believe that , by adopting it , things will be better for national unity in canada . 
i fear , honourable senators , that the opposite is the case . 
the supreme court itself , in its advisory opinion , upon which the government tries to rely in this bill , states in stark and unambiguous terms that , notwithstanding the envisaged process , unconstitutional secession remains possible . 
unfortunately , honourable senators , a unilateral declaration of independence is now made more likely should the provisions of this bill become law . 
here is what the court states in the last paragraph of its advisory opinion . 
in paragraph 155 the court said : 
although there is no right , under the constitution or in international law , to unilateral secession , that is secession without negotiation on the basis just discussed , this does not rule out the possibility of an unconstitutional declaration of secession leading to a de facto secession . 
the ultimate success of such a secession would be dependent on recognition by the international community . 
this is what the court told us after its long discussion on the process it envisaged . 
honourable senators , i have on the wall of my office a framed copy of the american declaration of independence . 
there are two stickers on it . 
one says " udi " and the other says " illegal and unconstitutional " . 
bill c - 20 does not rule out the possibility of an unconstitutional declaration of secession , but the steps outlined in this bill make such an eventuality more probable . 
why ? 
how does bill c - 20 facilitate the secessionist movement ? 
the answer flows , honourable senators , from the inherent logic of the three steps for legal secession provided for by the bill . 
the mechanism of the bill for dealing with the adjudication of the clarity of the question creates an advantage for the secessionist movement by co - opting the federal government and parliament into being a player in the secessionist process . 
if the house of commons gives preapproval to a referendum question , this by itself is a major gain for the secessionist province . 
it is equally a major loss for canada because , having granted preapproval , the rest of canada will not be able to challenge the question . 
it is also important to note that what might be considered clear in ottawa is not necessarily clear in other parts of canada . 
imagine , honourable senators , the confusion if some of the provinces , for their own particular reasons , disagreed with the house of commons on the clarity question . 
then consider the next step , honourable senators . 
if the federal government refuses to work with the secessionist province in determining the clear question , the international community will be told that ottawa is acting in bad faith , thereby making it much easier for the international recognition to occur as indicated by paragraph 155 of the court ' s opinion . 
in other words , the bill gets the international community off the hook . 
they will be told by the secessionists that they are following the law of canada and therefore , in terms of international diplomacy , it will make it easy for the international community to grant the recognition . 
the provisions of the bill dealing with the assessment of a clear majority of a referendum result once again plays right into the hands of the secessionists . 
it allows the secessionist movement the opportunity to seek international recognition because of the majority , whatever that majority number may be . 
consider , honourable senators , the membership of the francophonie . 
without naming countries , how many of them would require a majority of 50 per cent plus one for the recognition of a secessionist province ? 
consider the general who is the head of state of a given country , a leader who has the support of only 12 per cent of the vote but has the army on his side . 
how will such a leader view a 50 - per - cent - plus - one result ? 
the international community , honourable senators , will have little difficulty in giving recognition under these circumstances . 
we ought not fool ourselves . 
the bill speaks to the process of negotiating secession with a province . 
up to this time , all canadian prime ministers have consistently refused to agree to any such negotiation . 
furthermore , given the plethora of examples of failed canadian political negotiations , the chances of successful negotiations are remote . 
witness all the failed negotiations , in many of which some honourable senators have participated , on matters that we across canada agree on . 
this part of the process , as set out in the bill , once again gives the separatist movement another golden opportunity to argue bad faith in negotiations and then call for recognition by the international community . 
the sixth preambular paragraph of the bill asserts : 
... the secession of a province , to be lawful , would require an amendment to the constitution of canada . 
such a constitutional amendment must involve the provinces . 
however , again , the record of constitutional discussions among the provinces and the federal government is more a history of disagreement than a story of agreement . 
thus , again , the scenario foreseen by the supreme court in its opinion at paragraph 155 becomes more plausible . 
honourable senators , i will turn for a moment to the matter of who shall determine the clarity of the question . 
who are the " political actors " who shall be involved in the determination of the clarity of the question ? 
the seventh preambular paragraph , and also clause 1 of the bill , as we all know , limits this to members of the house of commons . 
it seems to me that it is a classical non sequitur of logic for the bill to state , in the second preambular paragraph , that the matter of secession is of the utmost gravity and then to exclude one of the two houses of parliament from a determinative role . 
honourable senators will recall that the supreme court in its opinion at paragraph 32 pointed out that there are four fundamental and organizing principles of the constitution , including respect for minorities . 
the senate of canada has been an integral part of our bicameral westminster model of parliamentary democracy since 1867 . 
indeed , the very establishment of the senate was one of the keys to the bringing about of confederation . 
throughout our 133 - year history , it has been the senate that has defended the rights of regions and ensured respect for minorities . 
it is , therefore , critical that the senate of canada play a determining role in a matter as important to minorities in regions of canada as the secession of a part of canada . 
the mover of the bill in the senate has attempted to argue that only the executive power has any mandate to conduct constitutional negotiations and that it was not necessary to limit this mandate as proposed by the bill . 
we must remind the honourable senator that under our system of governance it is not one wherein parliament has no supervisory role over the political aspects of constitutional negotiations . 
rather , our parliamentary system is one in which the senate and the house of commons provide significant supervision of the activities of the executive . 
even had the government not introduced this measure , which i would have preferred it did not , it would not mean that the executive power would have been free of supervision by parliament . 
indeed , one of the major functions of this house since confederation and today is precisely to supervise the political process and the exercise of power , not only by the executive but also its exercise by the lower house . 
in the matter before us , the court has stated that it has no supervisory role . 
if both houses of parliament did not have this role , the government , which controls the house of commons , would be totally unaccountable , a situation , no doubt , longed for by certain officials in the langevin building , but not one that is in the best interests of canada . 
the fact that our standing senate committee on national finance is currently examining the estimates , and that the other day we voted on supply , or that the leader of the government in the senate daily replies to questions and gives an account of government activities , would surely provide prima facie evidence and underscore the supervisory role of this chamber . 
indeed , the role of the government leader in the senate is not only one in which he or she represents the government in the senate but also represents the senate at the cabinet table . 
i shall return to this important issue shortly , honourable senators . 
the drafters and proponents of the bill tell us that they have remained faithful to the advisory opinion of the court in drafting this legislative proposal . 
however , if you examine , honourable senators , who the court stated ought to be involved in determining the clarity of a referendum question and the clarity of the result , the court stated that it would be the political actors who make this determination . 
at paragraphs 100 and 153 of the court ' s opinion , honourable senators can read : 
... it will be for the political actors to determine what constitutes ` a clear majority on a clear question ' in the circumstances under which a future referendum vote may be taken . 
minister dion ' s published notes , which i took off the web on january 14 , 2000 , explicate the bill with references to this matter . 
his notes state clearly that with respect to the seventh preambular paragraph and clause 1 , concerning that only members of the house of commons have a determining role in the clarity of the question and the result , the drafting for those sections - and this is the minister ' s own notes - comes from paragraphs 100 and 153 of the court ' s opinion . 
honourable senators , i invite you to read those paragraphs and read the bill . 
it gets worse . 
on page 2 , in the second paragraph , the drafters write : 
whereas , in light of the finding by the supreme court of canada that it would be for elected representatives - 
it is there in black and white . 
the drafters , i submit , have not remained faithful to the expressly written opinion of the court . 
the court said political actors . 
the court did not limit this determining judgment on the clarity of the question or the clarity of the result to elected representatives . 
honourable senators , the mover of the bill in the senate in his second reading speech said : 
how would the process begin ? 
who would make the original evaluation about whether there was a clear majority on a clear question ? 
who , in the view of the court , are the political actors who would have the obligation to make such decisions ? 
though the court does not answer this question directly - 
indeed , the court does not list who the " political actors " are , for it is self - evident that the political actors at the provincial level are the members of the legislative assemblies and that at the federal level they are the members of the parliament of canada - senators and members of the house of commons . 
senator boudreau , when referring to paragraph 101 of the advisory opinion , then weakens his case by attempting to argue that the phrase " elected representatives " is used by the court . 
however , honourable senators , read paragraph 101 . 
if you read it , you will see that the court is discussing in that paragraph the issue of negotiations and the phrase " elected representatives " is used and restricted to negotiations which , at the end of the day , the electors can ultimately assess . 
it is evident , honourable senators , that bill c - 20 does not follow the opinion of the court . 
the drafters of this bill are in error . 
they are in error in their attempt to try to exclude the senate from a determinative role in the matter of the clarity of the question and the clarity of the majority . 
perhaps sadly , honourable senators , it is a more serious error when this attempt to exclude the senate is undertaken overtly , under the guise of claiming that the supreme court said that only " elected representatives " should play this role when , in fact , the court said no such thing . 
honourable senators , let us now turn our attention to the historic collateral damage that this bill threatens ; that is , the threat of damage to the senate , perhaps unintentionally . 
nevertheless , bill c - 20 will , in its present form , do historical damage to the position of the senate in our bicameral parliament . 
unless it is dealt with by the majority of the current sitting senators in this place , we will be judged by history as being accomplices to a serious impairment of the position of the senate in the process of providing the oversight to government executive action . 
unless the majority in this chamber acts , it will be during our watch that the senate of canada ceased to be an important part of the checks and balances which kept canada a parliamentary democracy . 
i must once again note that second preambular paragraph of bill c - 20 , which states : 
whereas any proposal relating to the break - up of a democratic state is a matter of the utmost gravity and is of fundamental importance to all of its citizens ; 
it is simply inconceivable , honourable senators , that the senate of canada , one - half of our bicameral parliament , would not have a determinative role in matters of the utmost gravity . 
if one is to accept this proposition , then one is diminishing the role of the senate to deal with only the unimportant issues of the day . 
an attempt to secure the consent of only one house on matters of " the utmost gravity " would be a very serious intrusion on the right of parliament to have its consent protected . 
in fact , if we follow the argument advanced by senator fraser last thursday to its logical conclusion , we will have a two - tier legislative system in parliament . 
at page 914 of last thursday ' s debates of the senate , the honourable senator stated : 
we do not block the clearly expressed popular will , even in matters where , in law , we have the power to do so . 
the rest of the honourable senator ' s argumentation is so interesting that i think i should quote it in full : 
then there is the class of matters where we did not have that power - a class that is so fundamentally political that it is the exclusive prerogative of the house of commons , the chamber of the people ' s elected representatives . 
i find myself , however , powerfully affected by the argument that the focus of bill c - 20 , the government ' s approach to the possible secession of a province of canada , is another such subject , something that is so fundamentally , inherently political , so directly and intimately bound up with the will of the people , that it , too , falls into that small but crucial class where it is the house of commons and not parliament as a whole that must take the decision and , of course , bear the responsibility for doing so . 
now , honourable senators , by that thesis , we have a crucial class of statutes , so crucial that one of the two houses of parliament can have no role . 
may i remind honourable senators that just in the last parliament alone , on the pearson bill and on the electoral boundaries adjustment act , two constitutionally flawed statutes , that the senate did exercise its legislative power and defeat them . 
are we now to ask to which class statutes belong when they arrive in the senate , as well ? 
we may have no power to initiate money bills ; they are sent here to be dealt with . 
are we now to inquire whether these fall into the untouchable class ? 
my colleague senator beaudoin , in his questions , developed that point very clearly . 
if we are to have a constitutional amendment to limit the power of the senate of canada , then let us have it , but surely the government should not be proceeding in this way by a simple statute . 
however , i will leave that argument to be developed further by senator beaudoin . 
political writer j . e . hodgetts has written that the bicameral parliament has a major responsibility to provide oversight and supervision of the government ' s actions . 
in quoting from hodgetts : 
parliament is the legislature ' s capacity to act as the great debating , if not educational forum for the nation . 
this capacity , joined with the historic right to have grievances settled by the crown before approving money in support of the crown ' s activities , vests in the legislature not only the formal responsibility for approving statutes but also a continuing critical overseeing of executive actions . 
honourable senators , let us focus for a moment on the judgment or assessment by the senate , whether on legislation or on resolutions , the judgment of the senate . 
the assessment of this house on legislation or government actions has resulted in qualitatively different judgments than those judgments that are rendered by the house of commons . 
we , in this chamber , would do well to recall that the senate was established to provide what george é tienne cartier called " a power of resistance to oppose the democratic element . " 
honourable senators , on the wall of the senate speaker ' s chambers is that famous quote from cicero : 
translated , it means that it is our principle duty , honourable senators , to oppose the fickleness of the multitudes . 
honourable senators , it is senator boudreau ' s theory that because the house of commons could adopt a motion of non - confidence in the government , this is the only leverage at play to ensure the principle of responsible government . 
i submit that is simply false . 
there are many elements at play under our system of governance and in which the principle of responsible government has evolved . 
some scholars argue that with the shift of power to the centre and the control exercised by the executive over the legislature , there has been a significant lessening of governmental accountability to parliament - certainly , little in the house of commons . 
however , the power of the senate to analyze and critique the government is an essential element in the series of checks and balances which keeps that awesome power of the government somewhat responsible , somewhat accountable . 
indeed , the defeat of a major government measure in this place would speak directly to the legitimacy of that government ' s ability to continue . 
the free trade agreement required a general election to intervene before the liberal - dominated senate agreed to adopt that measure . 
the author punnett wrote that " the evolution of the westminster system of government has left parliament with the vital function of criticising and publicizing government activities . " 
thus , the modern role of parliament is not to seek to overthrow the government but , rather , to hold the government accountable . 
that is what responsible government means in the world of the 21 st century . 
the argument of our colleague senator boudreau , that the senate should not have a determinative role in bill c - 20 because it is not a house of confidence , is not persuasive . 
let me make a comment , and respectfully so , of the role of the minister in the senate . 
the fact that ministers are drawn typically from both houses of parliament demonstrates the capacity of the legislature to influence the executive . 
many honourable senators are asking the following questions : 
what representations , if any , did the minister in the senate bring to the cabinet table when this idea of trying to exclude the senate from a determinative role in bill c - 20 was first raised ? 
did the minister articulate the purpose and place of this chamber in our bicameral parliament ? 
did he explain the historic role of the senate and the principles of consent , second sober thought , and protection of minority rights upon which the senate operates ? 
did he underscore the oversight function that the senate has in the series of checks and balances that keep within control the exercise of executive power ? 
or , honourable senators , did the leader of the government in the senate find himself in a conflict situation ? 
did the impossibility of serving the senate and aspiring for a place in the house of commons place him in a conflict role and cause confusion ? 
the confidentiality that surrounds cabinet deliberations will not let us know what happened . 
what we do know is that the process that has led to the drafting of bill c - 20 has failed the senate of canada . 
honourable senators , senator boudreau attempts to argue that , because the senate has only a 180 - day suspensive veto on matters of amendments to the constitution , therefore , it should not have a determinative role to play under bill c - 20 . that argument , honourable senators , fails on several accounts . 
first , the fact that there is a six - month veto for the senate in matters of constitutional amendment is no small power . 
our colleague senator molgat , who chaired the committee of the whole examining the meech lake accord , will recall the effectiveness of the six - month delay period . 
indeed , it was during this period that the meech lake accord began to unravel . 
when one adds this senate delaying check for constitutional integrity to the additional checks provided by the requirement for support from resolutions adopted by provincial legislatures , numbers depending on which amending formula , then senator boudreau ' s case is weak indeed . 
let us note that , with constitutional amendments , the provincial political actors have a real determining function , not merely a consultative role , as in the determining of the question of the majority in this bill . 
second , senator boudreau ' s argument also fails in its appreciation of the senate ' s delaying power . 
at a time in canadian history when the prime minister ' s office dominates the house of commons through a party majority that is controlled by its whip , the senate of canada remains the only real parliamentary limitation on the government ' s power . 
furthermore , the senate plays a critical role in explicating and analyzing government initiatives such that the people of canada can be better informed of the issues before parliament or the undertakings by the government . 
senator boudreau asserts that it would be difficult " to fit the senate in . " 
honourable senators , there are so many ways in which the senate ' s judgment on the clarity of the question could be secured without delaying the time line envisaged by the bill . 
for example , there could be a fixed number of sittings in which each house of parliament would make its determination , or we could consider a process by which both houses sit jointly in the determination of the clarity of the question . 
honourable senators , with the talent in this chamber and with a minimal degree of creativity , other such models could and must be developed to maintain and secure the integrity of this house . 
let me conclude , honourable senators , by noting that the history of the canadian adventure is a story of diverse peoples from diverse regions of the world living across a vast land in which regional and provincial differences have been accommodated by compromise and flexibility . 
this bill is a gift to the secessionist movement . 
this bill is a way out for the international community . 
this bill is a straitjacket for future prime ministers . 
macdonald , laurier , pearson and diefenbaker have , no doubt , turned over in their graves . 
trudeau and mulroney are surely saddened by this give - away to the secessionist movement . 
honourable senators , people of goodwill do not win battles either of weapons or of ideas by remaining perpetually on the defensive . 
to want no more than to stop secession thereby ensures that ultimately secession cannot be stopped . 
far more important than any purported steps taken to lessen the threat or limit the challenge of secession are the positive aims , policies and visions which all the peoples of canada wish to achieve themselves . 
rather , it will survive if it continues to be inspired by the enabling faith of our predecessors . 
canada now needs a new generation of political actors , men and women of goodwill , to draw more closely together in understanding , creativity and collaboration . 
rather than presenting a bill that facilitates secession , rather than promoting legislation that , for the first time in the 133 - year history of canada , makes secession legal , rather than accepting the assumption that canada is divisible , the government should be recognizing the right of the peoples of quebec to self - determination and through positive , persuasive programs , based on the successful canadian device of persuasion and compromise , fulfil the aspirations and dreams of all within an indivisible canada . 
the supreme court was asked for its opinion on what is essentially a socio - political question . 
the pith and substance of the quebec reference case is situated within the historic claim of quebec as a distinct society . 
what the government has given us in bill c - 20 is a statute that will make legal , for the first time in our history , a secessionist claim from any province and on any ground , even the simple ground of an economic objective . 
in my opinion , honourable senators , the government , sadly , has lost its way , and the canadian people , under the seductive guise of clarity , might well lose their country . 
some hon. senators : 
hear , hear ! 
hon. j . bernard boudreau ( leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , would the honourable senator kinsella permit a question or two ? 
senator kinsella : 
of course , as many as the honourable senator wishes . 
senator boudreau : 
the honourable senator kinsella draws some scenarios and reaches some conclusions with which i take some exception . 
i will not follow all of the trails he set out , but there were two fundamental principles upon which he built his case . 
the first fundamental principle was that canada is indivisible . 
if we accept that principle , then what is the point of having legislation that deals with whether the question is clear or not clear and whether the required majority it is 50 per cent plus 1 , or 80 per cent , or 90 per cent or whatever ? 
senator lynch - staunton : 
is the leader of the government asking himself that question ? 
senator boudreau : 
that is exactly the question . 
senator kinsella is rejecting the bill on the principle that canada is indivisible , and he cites the american constitution as an example . 
senator kinsella : 
as well as the mexican constitution . 
senator boudreau : 
i am not sure the american constitution is an example that the canadian people would be willing to follow . 
the americans fought a civil war . 
in that civil war , more americans were killed than in all of the other wars in their history put together . 
they fought that war because they believed that under no circumstances was their country divisible . 
i am not sure that is a principle that the people of canada or , perhaps , honourable senators can accept . 
on the honourable senator ' s point of rejecting the bill altogether , does he disagree with the leader of his party who favours a 50 per cent plus 1 test ? 
does he reject that test ? 
as well , does he reject any formula , for example , that would see a two - thirds majority of all eligible voters casting a yes vote on a clear question ? 
does he reject both of those options ? 
senator kinsella : 
i thank the honourable leader for his question . 
my position is that this bill ought not be proceeded with because it is ultra vires to the power of this house and , indeed , ultra vires to the power of the other place . 
that is my starting point . 
i do not think we have the authority to pass a law that is not in the best interests of canada . 
any law that has as its ultimate objective an orderly , legal breakup of canada is not in the best interests of canada . 
honourable senators , we only have authority to pass laws that are in the best interests of canada . 
that is why i say i do not think we have the power , which was the question asked by senator nolin . 
perhaps someone can point out to me where in the parliament of canada act or the constitution act , 1867 or 1982 , that authority is given to parliament . 
i cannot find it . 
the realpolitik we are dealing with in this house is that the opposition is in the minority . 
thus , this bill is an awesome burden because of the collateral damage to the senate of canada . 
if not corrected , it will become an awesome responsibility on the shoulders of my colleagues , particularly my colleagues opposite . 
hopefully , we will find the creativity to deal with that responsibility . 
if the majority decides to go forward , assuming that the matter is not ultra vires to parliament , it seems to me it is a responsibility of the opposition to continue , in the epistemological sense of criticism , to improve a bad situation . 
we must , therefore , deal with the kinds of amendments that could be brought forward . 
this is why we must amend the provision that has relativized the senate . 
it is wrong - headed and not necessary . 
the same objectives can be achieved without doing that , and i have suggested a few such ways . 
on the fundamental principle of my assumption that canada is indivisible , clearly , i find fault with the opinion of the supreme court . 
to the extent this bill is resting on that foundation , if the foundation has fault lines , then this bill is being erected on those fault lines . 
the burden of proof on those who wish to make this change is to prove that the country is divisible . 
my position is that it is indivisible , and i will sustain and argue that position . 
i believe that the people of canada share the view that canada is indivisible rather than divisible . 
senator boudreau : 
honourable senators , i appreciate that position . 
what i was asking for is the honourable senator ' s personal view . 
in this place , from time to time , we all make compromises on the result that emerges . 
i was interested in hearing his personal view on the issue of canada being indivisible and that , therefore , no vote on any question with any percentage would lead to secession . 
i must say that i disagree with him . 
i am glad , however , that his personal view is clearly before us . 
if this legislation is ultra vires , then the supreme court will pass the ultimate judgment on that point . 
it will probably do so much more capably - and i speak for myself - than i would be able to do . 
however , now that we have established our fundamental disagreement on whether any result would justify negotiations , i wish to pose a second question . 
it , too , relates to the fundamental principle on which i think the honourable senator takes objection to the role of the senate . 
he said that the senate has traditionally exercised a supervisory role over constitutional negotiations by the executive . 
however , that was roughly the way i wrote down the honourable senator ' s remark . 
the honourable senator cannot mean legislative supervision because the bill does not impact on that capacity . 
it will still remain . 
thus , since he is not talking about the legislative process , he must be talking about something else . 
sure enough , in the next two or three sentences , the honourable senator cleared up what he was talking about . 
he said that in question period in the senate , the leader of the government , as a minister , must stand up and answer the questions of honourable senators . 
in fact , that was one of the supervisory roles . 
the second example the honourable senator gave had to do with our passage of supply bills . 
i suppose if we refused to pass such bills , that would create all sorts of problems . 
currently , that is how the senate apparently exercises a supervisory role over constitutional negotiations by the executive . 
we will still have those examples tomorrow , next month , next year , and long after this bill passes . 
in fact , the bill has no impact , first , on the legislative side of the senate ' s role and , second , on the supervisory role to which the honourable senator refers . 
in neither case does the bill have any impact on facets of our supervisory role . 
where will the supervisory role of the senate , traditionally exercised on the right of the executive to negotiate , be damaged ? 
senator kinsella : 
honourable senators , this thrust had to be developed because of the faulty theory of responsible government the leader of the government in the senate advanced during his second reading speech . 
the leader put forward that theory to attempt to justify the fact that the senate would not have a determining role on the matter of the clarity of both the question and the result . 
honourable senators , it is my view that the senate of canada has a supervisory role . 
the senate of canada and the other place each have a responsibility and a duty to hold the government accountable . 
in our system , honourable senators , governments are not non - accountable . 
some would like not to be held accountable , but our whole system of parliamentary democracy is based upon the principle of ministerial accountability . 
this house , contrary to the view in some quarters - and this is a view that might have received some impetus in your theory of responsible government - has a supervisory role over the exercise of executive power . 
with reference to the exercise of executive power in the matter of constitutional negotiations , i agreed with the honourable senator when he said that it was not necessary for the government to have the approval , by legislation , of parliament , to exercise that executive power to hold constitutional negotiations . 
i would have preferred that the government not bring in the bill and not try to fetter , but , even if it did not , it would not have been absolved from oversight by this house and from oversight by the other place . 
the executive power is not unaccountable power , even when the exercise of that executive power deals with constitutional matters . 
this is different from the amending process under the constitution , which requires a resolution of both houses , although the resolution in this house , if not given , is effectively suspensive for 180 days . 
honourable senators , we must not allow the myth to be perpetuated that the senate of canada does not have both a supervisory responsibility and a responsibility to hold to account the exercise of executive power , because we do . 
senator boudreau : 
i do not think i disagree with the honourable senator on that at all . 
the senate and the house of commons have a supervisory role , and there are executive powers , as referred to by the honourable senator in the main body of his speech . 
where we disagree is that this bill will make any difference at all to the role of the senate in exercising that supervisory power . 
at this point , i fail to see what difference it makes . 
how will the role of the senate be different , in terms of all the powers and the important role it now enjoys ? 
how will that role be changed by this legislation ? 
senator kinsella : 
it will be changed fundamentally , and in a historically damaging fashion . 
the senate of canada will have become relativized and made second class in its view on the determination of what would constitute a clear question in a referendum and what would constitute a clear majority . 
by excluding the senate of canada from a determinative role where the house of commons would have a determinative role would cause fundamental damage to the senate of canada , in its usages and its practices . 
it would be decisively fatal to the tradition of parliamentary consent . 
hon. b . alasdair graham : 
honourable senators , i have one question , for the purpose of clarity . 
the honourable senator kinsella made reference to the principle of 50 , plus one . 
is it the honourable senator ' s opinion that one vote should be sufficient to break up this country ? 
senator kinsella : 
absolutely not . 
i tend to agree with my colleague senator lynch - staunton , who spoke to this particular issue . 
i make the point that , with reference to the facade of security that this bill is presenting , we must take seriously what the supreme court has told us . 
we can go through all these steps , but unconstitutional and illegal unilateral declaration of independence is still a possibility . 
the court is warning us . 
therefore , when you examine each of these steps and examine the step concerning what will constitute a clear majority , there will be very few countries around the world that will be looking for the high standard of 66 per cent when they are asked to give international recognition to a secessionist province . 
few countries around the world would also refuse to give international recognition to a secessionist province if itwas 50 , plus one . 
indeed , as i mentioned in parenthesis , there are many countries with which we have good relations - governments that operate without anything close to a 50 per cent , plus one support . 
in the presentation notes , the honourable senator made reference and linked 50 , plus one to the dictator who had 12 per cent but also had an army . 
i took that reference to mean that 50 , plus one would be sufficient . 
that is the impression i got from your remarks to break up the country . 
senator kinsella : 
i thank the honourable senator for that input . 
the serious issue involves the " political actors " referred to by the court , namely , the international political actors . 
at the end of the day , they will determine whether or not we will have canada broken up into a series of countries . 
the court has told us that . 
this bill is ill - advised because it lays out these steps , which at each point are destined to failure . 
thus , at each point , a gift or golden opportunity is handed on a silver platter to the secessionist movement . 
this is a very foolish approach to dealing with the matter . 
certain principles were identified in the advisory opinion . 
we should have left well enough alone . 
this only makes matters worse . 
hon. joan fraser : 
honourable senators , i should like to return to the question of indivisibility . 
this absolutely crucial question goes to the very heart of what we are as a country . 
i am afraid that i still do not quite understand senator kinsella ' s position . 
he began by saying , and i am sure we would all agree , that there are only two ways to hold a country together - by force or by persuasion . 
he went to say , and again i expect we would all agree , that we would not support the use of force . 
then he went on to cite , with apparent approval , a number of regimes where it is not permissible to secede . 
he cited the united states , which had recourse to force for four years to prevent secession . 
he cited mexico , which has had recourse to force . 
he could have cited other federations - russia , india and perhaps some others . 
i thank the honourable senator for that question . 
first and foremost , i reiterate my view that canada is indivisible . 
second , when one examines the theory and the argumentation in the advisory opinion of the supreme court , it is based upon an analysis of constitutionalism , the rule of law , democracy and federalism . 
if , however , our starting point is the divisibility of canada and we set out a process and erect a stage , then that act will be played out . 
if our response to the secessionist movement is always one of defence , then at the end of the day , the secessionist movement will succeed . 
i suggest , honourable senators , that the solution lays in the generation of new ideas , recognizing that there is great diversity among the peoples of canada . 
i do not want to use the jargon of plan a and plan b , but others find that jargon attractive . 
clearly , as the leader of the liberal party of quebec so metaphorically describes it , we are going into a big black hole . 
hon. g é rald - a . 
by way of supplementary to the question of senator boudreau , if a simple statute can give a power to one house and not to the other , is it not the case that if this is done five or six times in a certain period of time , the powers of the other house are reduced considerably ? 
i refer to the senate , our house . 
this would be done without any amendment to the constitution . 
senator kinsella : 
i could not agree more . 
i am hopeful that senator beaudoin will develop that particular theme clearly . 
we have the written acts . 
we have the constitution act of 1867 , the constitution act of 1982 , and we have customs and usages , just as within parliament we have the parliament of canada act and the rules of this chamber . 
we also have customs and usages that would develop very rapidly for a whole variety of reasons , including the current selection process of members of this house . 
we will be the ones who will be held accountable for the relativizing in our time , during our watch , of the senate of canada vis - à - vis the house of commons . 
honourable senators , i cannot see how we could do anything but work together to at least solve that problem . 
it is solvable . 
hon. jerahmiel s . grafstein : 
honourable senators , i listened with great care to senator kinsella . 
i congratulate him on his ability to set out these issues from his perspective . 
he has two constitutional objections , as i hear them . 
one is the diminution of the power of the senate , which has been echoed by senator beaudoin , based on the constitution and the conventions of the constitution . 
i will not comment on that issue at this time , but i am interested in the senator ' s first proposition , which is the ultra vires nature of the legislation . 
he bases it , if i am correct , on his view that the advisory judgment of the supreme court may have some fault lines . 
senator kinsella : 
honourable senators , unfortunately , in the advisory opinion in the quebec reference case , the court does not attend to the issue of where parliament might or might not have the authority to bring in this kind of legislation . 
indeed , nowhere in the decision is the court recommending that this kind of legislation would even be brought in . 
indeed , the former chief justice expressed surprise that a statutory provision was brought in along this line . 
if that matter were to be pursued , we would need to ask the court its opinion on whether there is a constitutional basis or where the authority exists for parliament to pass a law that has the effect of breaking up canada . 
the court does not tell us that . 
senator grafstein : 
again this gives me some concern . 
i cannot believe that anyone who has ever come to this chamber would have that as an objective . 
i think we all have the shared value , based on our constitutional oath , to uphold the constitution and uphold the unity of the country . 
however , now we are faced with an advisory , and the advisory has raised questions . 
if the executive chooses , as the leader of the government has suggested , to exercise its discretion in a particular way , and perhaps limit its discretion in a particular way , how is that constitutionally objectionable , laying aside the role of the senate ? 
senator kinsella : 
that is precisely the point . 
the executive did not have to seek the approval of the house of commons to go through this process . 
the executive does not need this legislation to do whatever it wants to do in this area . 
however , each house of parliament will have the duty and responsibility to hold accountable the government of the day for whatever it does in this field . 
here , the house of commons is being co - opted into this process . 
how will the house of commons hold accountable the executive in a process into which they are now co - opted ? 
will senator kinsella take yet one more question ? 
senator kinsella : 
yes. 
senator bryden : 
i listened to senator kinsella ' s presentation , and paid particular heed to the part about the country being indivisible and the part where he said that we cannot use force to keep canada together . 
we do not have the power to do it by any other means , except , i guess , persuasion . 
as i listened , i was reminded of someone who for many years was a professor at st. thomas university , and perhaps still is . 
he was a follower of aristotle . 
while listening to the remarks , it occurred to me that the logic , at least in aristotelian terms , gets a little convoluted . 
we are saying that the country is indivisible ; that it cannot be broken up . 
we have no jurisdiction . 
there is nothing in our laws to deal with that . 
the united states cannot be broken up , but they used force to do so . 
we would not do that . 
will the problem be like that of the man who had a psychological fixation that he was dead ? 
an aristotelian logician said , " i can force him to recognize that he is not dead . 
i can force him to recognize that he is alive . 
just give me a few minutes with him . " 
it was agreed and he went to see the man who said that he was dead . 
the logician asked , " do you believe that you are dead , that you are not alive ? " 
the man replied , " yes , i do . " 
the logician said , " let me ask you a question . 
do dead men bleed ? " 
the response was , " no , sir , dead men do not bleed . " 
the fellow said , " my god , dead men do bleed ! " 
senator kinsella : 
i think that senator bryden ' s argumentation is not so much aristotelian as sophism . 
however , even with that , canada will be gone . 
i will use a different metaphor to that of senator bryden ' s . 
i will use as my metaphor the beautiful victorian home that senator robichaud used to have on waterloo road in fredericton . 
the house would last for hundreds of years , except that its wiring was the old cloth wiring from the turn of the century and the place was a fire trap . 
does senator robichaud hire an electrical contractor to rewire the place , or does he buy fire insurance ? 
i suggest , honourable senators , that this measure of the government is " buying fire insurance . " 
on motion of senator hays , debate adjourned . 
business of the senate 
hon. dan hays ( deputy leader of the government ) : 
before we proceed , however , honourable senators , i should like to ask leave that we not see the clock for one hour . 
if we are done before that , all the better , but assuming leave is granted , i have one other matter which i should like to raise . 
the hon. the speaker : 
is there leave that i not see the clock for one hour ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
the hon. the speaker : 
therefore , at seven o ' clock i will leave the chair , unless there is further agreement . 
fisheries 
committee authorized to meet 
honourable senators , with leave of the senate and notwithstanding rule 58 ( 1 ) ( a ) , i move : 
that the standing senate committee on fisheries have power to sit at 6 p.m. today even though the senate may then be sitting , and that rule 95 ( 4 ) be suspended in relation thereto . 
the hon. the speaker : 
is leave granted , honourable senators ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to . 
marine liability bill 
second reading 
on the order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the honourable senator furey , seconded by the honourable senator fraser , for the second reading of bill s - 17 , respecting marine liability , and to validate certain by - laws and regulations . 
hon. w . david angus : 
honourable senators , i am somewhat hesitant , even humbled , to introduce my rather technical subject after listening to the learned debate this afternoon on bill c - 20 . the quality of the debate has been unusually high and fascinating , given the nature of the subject matter - the very survival of our great nation . 
i rise to make a few comments on bill s - 17 , which was introduced by the honourable senator boudreau and received first reading in this chamber on march 2 , 2000 . 
the bill was addressed and proposed for second reading on tuesday , march 21 by senator furey . 
let me say at the outset , honourable senators , one , that i firmly support this legislation and advocate its expeditious passage through the parliamentary process , including appropriate study by the standing senate committee on transport and communications , and by the transport committee in the other place . 
two , i note with great pleasure that the government has once again taken steps to move forward with this now long - overdue legislation , and all the more so , honourable senators , because it has chosen to initiate the process here in the senate . 
it is an initiative of which i hope we will see more . 
three , i deplore the government ' s repeated ham - handed parliamentary mismanagement of this particular legislation , both in its present form and in its earlier manifestations , leading to unfortunate and substantial delays , so that canada ' s otherwise excellent image in the domestic and international maritime law and insurance community has been tarnished and called into question , both at home and abroad . 
as a number of honourable senators i believe are aware , i have devoted the bulk of my 38 - year career as a lawyer to the practice of maritime law in all its aspects . 
i served from 1988 through 1991 as president of the canadian maritime law association , and i am currently , and have been since 1994 , a member of the executive council of the comit é maritime international , the cmi , in antwerp , belgium , which is the private - sector international marine law association that brings together as constituent members some 50 national maritime law associations from around the world . 
i have for many years been interested in and , indeed , committed to the development of uniform canadian and international maritime law , and the harmonization globally of its principle rules and regulations . 
thus , i am very pleased to have this opportunity to associate myself with and support the principles and objectives of bill s - 17 . 
i say this not only to indicate to honourable senators my special interest in this legislation , but also to demonstrate a modicum of first - hand knowledge of the matters and issues in the bill , especially of the on - going importance of both national and international uniformity of laws , such as those that establish regimes of marine liability , and rules and standards relating to the safety of ships and life at sea . 
canada has for decades participated actively and with distinction in international organizations dedicated to promoting uniformity and harmonization of maritime law , including the international maritime organization , the imo , and the cmi . 
more important , though , the bill , as it purports to create a new marine liability statute for canada that can be added to and / or subtracted from as may be appropriate over the years going forward , falls into the category of framework legislation ; part of an overall restructuring , modernization and simplification of the main statutory elements of canadian maritime law . 
in this sense , honourable senators , i believe bill s - 17 to be a positive and constructive initiative . 
the substantive aspects of the bill concern , one , the long overdue adoption into canadian law , in part 4 of the bill , of the athens convention , relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage at sea , which sets forth an internationally accepted comprehensive regime of ship owners ' liability for loss of life or personal injury to passengers travelling onboard ships . 
existing canadian domestic legislation deals only with global limitation of liability for maritime claims , including passengers ' claims , but it fails to establish a basis upon which liability for passengers may be established , thus leaving shipboard passengers to rely on canada ' s various and , in some cases , uncertain provincial laws of negligence to solve their claims and obtain compensation . 
the athens convention was adopted by the imo , with canada ' s full approval , in december 1974 as a uniform convention , which was amended in 1990 by a protocol updating its limits of liability . 
it is now high time that canada implements this convention by incorporating it into our domestic law . 
the substantive aspects also concern , two , the adoption under federal law , which includes that certain body of law now known as " canadian maritime law " , in part 2 of the billa new regime for apportioning liability for marine claims , thus clarifying what is presently a difficult and confusing area of canadian law . 
if enacted , bill s - 17 will provide a uniform regime for the apportionment of liability applicable to all civil torts governed by canadian maritime law . 
three , part 1 of the bill also contains substantive new law in that it purports to update canadian maritime law so as to reflect recent developments in provincial fatal accidents legislation . 
i understand from officials at transport canada that another very important marine bill , a modernized and revitalized canada shipping act , will shortly be introduced in parliament as a companion to bill s - 17 . 
i hope this will take place once again here in the senate . 
four , part 5 of bill s - 17 basically incorporates word for word into the new marine liability act canada ' s hague rules statute , the carriage of goods by water act , which deals with shipowners and operators ' liability for cargo damage . 
however , one substantive and welcome change has been introduced inbill s - 17 , namely , a new provision that broadens the jurisdiction of canadian courts to deal with cargo claims , especially those of canadian exporters and importers and their insurers . 
this should improve recovery costs for canadian claimants , while at the same time providing badly needed new business for the down - and - out canadian maritime lawyers . 
honourable senators , as i have indicated , part 4 of bill s - 17 establishes the basis and amounts of liability of shipowners to their passengers for personal injury and loss of life . 
the new regime will apply to both domestic and international carriage of passengers by ship and , accordingly , will finally bring canadian law in this field into line with that of most of our trading partners . 
in most developed maritime nations , the laissez - faire system of liability in the marine transportation sector has long been replaced by some form of statutory liability . 
the athens convention is now the leading international model in the area of passenger claims . 
in canada , contracting out of liability by shipowners and operators , especially in marine passenger contracts issued by foreign carriers serving canada , has been more the rule than the exception . 
bill s - 17 , if enacted , will obviate this practice . 
such exculpatory clauses are no longer recognized in france , the united kingdom , the united states and elsewhere . 
they are also generally absent from contracts of carriage in other transportation systems here in canada , or are expressly prohibited , as in the air mode , pursuant to the carriage by air act . 
canada ' s marine industry enjoys a relatively good safety record . 
however , accidents can , and often do , happen . 
thus , it appears to be a good thing that the government is finally proceeding to ensure that canadian law is up - to - date and in line with that of our sister nations and our trading partners . 
what is troubling , however , honourable senators , is that we are only getting around to doing this now . 
a major passenger ship disaster in canadian waters today would doubtless generate a public outcry for fair and adequate compensation to victims precluded from being indemnified for their loss . 
frankly , the risk of such a casualty has been increasing through the use of large car ferries with substantial passenger capacity on both the east and west coasts , as well as the growing popularity of giant cruise liners which now regularly carry thousands of passengers inside and adjacent to canadian coastal waters . 
i submit that good public policy demands the resolution of this problem now and without further delay . 
why is it , then , that bill c - 59 , entitled carriage of passengers by water act , introduced in the second session of the thirty - fifth parliament , containing the exact same provisions as those set out in part 4 of bill s - 17 , was permitted by this government to die on the order paper in april 1997 ? 
this was indeed unfortunate , not to say risky and imprudent , if not impudent . 
let us all , in both houses , take heed for past government mismanagement and give this bill the serious and expeditious treatment it merits . 
to save time , honourable senators , i make reference to but will not repeat in extenso here today the comments i made in this chamber on october 21 , 1997 , respecting the inexcusable delays which preceded the enactment of bill s - 4 , another key statute dealing with marine liability , specifically , shipowners ' liability for maritime claims in general , and for marine pollution in particular , and the right to limit such liability and to what extent . 
one cannot help but wonder why marine policy and legislation in canada has heretofore seemingly had such a low priority on the government ' s agenda . 
after all , canada is a major maritime nation , with one of the world ' s most extensive coastlines . 
the athens convention is not the only international maritime convention which canada has approved at the diplomatic level and then been subjected to delayed implementation into our domestic law . 
another striking example is the hns convention dealing with the carriage of hazardous and noxious substances and a liability regime which is related thereto . 
these conventions in most cases deal with the economic and legal consequences of maritime accidents or casualties and are designed to harmonize the international law and practices of different nations so as to achieve uniformity of law and procedure and a level playing field in the marine arena , which is international by its very nature . 
once approved by our government at the diplomatic level , they should , as a matter of comity , at the very least , as well as for compelling practical reasons , be implemented with all due dispatch . 
many dedicated private canadian citizens and highly skilled bureaucrats have worked long and hard to achieve international consensus and to make these conventions good and valid realities . 
surely , it is now our duty as legislators to complete their fine work . 
let us not let them down again , either now or in the future . 
honourable senators , as far as i can determine , the new substantive maritime laws contained in bill s - 17 are noncontroversial and unopposed by any group or interest which had been identified to date . 
by contrast , the legislation is eagerly awaited by all elements of canada ' s marine industry , including shipowning , shipping , cargo , passenger , insurance , and maritime law interests alike . 
indeed , full and complete discussion papers have been circulated by government officials to all interested parties , and the main elements of what is now bill s - 17 have already received wide stakeholder approval and interest . 
honourable senators , the same may be said of the creation through bill s - 17 of a framework for a new canadian marine liability statute as a companion statute to the forthcoming modernized canada shipping act . 
the current legislative system , whereby liability regimes are set forth in various pieces of legislation , is not practical , effective , or satisfactory , and certainly is not user - friendly . 
a single statute devoted exclusively to issues of marine liability , present and future , will help all members of the marine community to better understand the responsibilities and the rights of those who are or will be affected by the laws in question . 
dare i say it , honourable senators , such consolidation may also significantly simplify , and perhaps even expedite , the work of many of canada ' s maritime lawyers . 
can this be a bad thing ? 
i have just one caveat to bring to your attention , honourable senators . 
hopefully , these issues will be raised and satisfactorily answered at the committee stage . 
hon. george furey : 
honourable senators - 
the hon. the speaker : 
honourable senators , i wish to inform the senate that if the honourable senator furey speaks now , his speech will have the effect of closing debate on the motion for second reading of this bill . 
senator furey : 
absent a few rather scathing swats which the honourable senator took at timeliness , i endorse his comments and thank him for his agreement in treating this bill as expeditiously as possible . 
indeed , the rather technical questions raised at the end of senator angus ' comments with respect to retroactivity will be addressed at committee . 
therefore , honourable senators , i commend this bill to you . 
the hon. the speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to and bill read second time . 
referred to committee 
the hon. the speaker : 
honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the third time ? 
on motion of senator furey , bill referred to the standing senate committee on transport and communications . 
national defence act 
bill to amend - second reading 
on the order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the honourable senator pearson , seconded by the honourable senator finestone , p . c . , for the second reading of bill s - 18 , to amend the national defence act ( non - deployment of persons under the age of eighteen years to theatres of hostilities ) . 
hon. michael a . meighen : 
honourable senators , i rise to speak briefly on the second reading of bill s - 18 , to amend the national defence act . 
i suppose , then , what is fair for the goose is fair for the gander . 
i am pleased to be speaking on a bill the government has seen fit to introduce in the senate . 
recognizing the usefulness of proceeding in this fashion , i encourage the government in its high counsel to do more of this . 
i will try to do likewise . 
however , she may be surprised to know that i agree with just about everything she said . 
i venture to say that all honourable senators on this side of the chamber feel the same way . 
senator pearson pointed out in her introduction that the proposed amendment before the senate will put into law that which is the current practice and policy of the department of national defence and will ensure that canada does not send persons under the age of 18 years into a theatre of hostilities . 
this amendment will also put canada in compliance with the recently negotiated optional protocol to the united nations convention on the rights of the child . 
the convention on the rights of the child was adopted by the united nations in 1989 and has since been ratified by 191 countries . 
the government of the right honourable brian mulroney was very closely involved in negotiation and development of the convention . 
it was signed by prime minister mulroney in 1990 and ratified by parliament in 1991 . 
i cannot pass up the opportunity to note that in this area , as in so many others , the current government is carrying on with important initiatives introduced by its predecessors . 
as stated by senator pearson , the optional protocol will establish new international standards that will require its signatories to set 18 years as the minimum age for compulsory recruitment ; to take all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forces who are under the age of 18 years do not take direct part in hostilities ; and to raise the minimum age for volunteer recruitment to at least 16 years of age and to deposit a binding declaration to this effect upon ratifying the optional protocol . 
under the terms of the optional protocol , signatories that permit voluntary recruitment of persons under the age of 18 years are required to maintain safeguards to ensure that recruitment is genuinely voluntary and that it is done with parental consent and reliable proof of age , something which i cannot help but mention seems to have been missing in 1939 and 1940 when many citizens , perhaps citizens familiar to members of this house , knowingly lied about their age in order to take part in combatting the spread of fascism . 
one cannot be critical of their motive in that case . 
finally , recruited candidates must be fully informed of the duties involved in military service . 
honourable senators doubtless know that the canadian forces are currently recruiting individuals aged 16 and 17 . 
however , sign - up is strictly on a volunteer basis and parental consent and proof of age are required . 
in addition , all candidates are informed of their duties as military personnel . 
it is interesting to note that , like canada , the u.s. is recruiting 16 - and 17 - year - olds . 
however , unlike canada , the u.s. is deploying these young soldiers in conflict zones . 
in recent years , these 17 - year - old soldiers have been deployed by the united states in the gulf war , in somalia and in bosnia . 
i am pleased to note that the u.s. recently agreed to put an end to the deployment of young soldiers under the age of 18 in combat zones . 
the problem of the use of children in an active military role is not insignificant . 
as i speak , hundreds of thousands of child soldiers are being used in armed conflicts around the world . 
human rights watch , an american human rights organization , reports that child soldiers are taking part or have taken part in 33 current or recent conflicts in almost all regions of the world . 
as i indicated earlier , honourable senators , our practice in canada is already fully in line with this optional protocol . 
however , i commend the government for acting to bring our legislation into line with our practice . 
we urge the government to work aggressively at the united nations to ensure that this protocol is adopted by the general assembly at an early date and that it is subsequently signed and ratified by the un member states . 
i urge all senators to support it . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
honourable senators , is it your pleasure to adopt the motion ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed and bill read second time . 
referred to committee 
on motion of senator hays , bill referred to the standing senate committee on foreign affairs . 
canadian institutes of health research bill 
second reading 
honourable senators , i have the honour to rise in support of bill c - 13 , to establish the canadian institutes of health research . 
canada ' s health research community already has a reputation for excellence throughout the world . 
major health discoveries have been made by canadians , such as dr. henry friesen , the present chair of the medical research council , who discovered the human hormone prolactin that affects fertility among women . 
canadians also lead in researching innovative approaches to help policy and administration . 
each year , canadian researchers win more than half the grants made available to foreign researchers by the united states national institutes of health . 
in order to continue and sustain health research in canada , we must recognize that the nature of modern health research is changing , and we need a health research system capable of understanding these complex new challenges . 
we need to be able to address emerging and re - emerging threats to our health . 
we must be able to take on challenges as diverse as the mysteries of mental health , as complicated as the development of antibiotics to combat new strains of bacteria , and as complex as determining the health impacts of family violence . 
in addition to studying illness and disease , our health research system needs to support the study of the social and environmental determinants of health . 
we need to integrate our findings with other research on the many factors that affect the health of communities and populations . 
we need , honourable senators , to position ourselves to take full advantage of the revolution in genetic technology that is opening up new avenues for treating disease . 
we must be able to make use of innovative methodologies and health services research that make it possible to better evaluate how well we are providing services to canadians through our health care system . 
these are challenges that will define how we promote , protect and improve the health of canadians over the next decades . 
honourable senators , bill c - 13 would create the canadian institutes of health research to respond to these challenges . 
it takes a fundamentally different approach to health research through the creation of institutes that will provide a strategic direction to research in thematic areas such as chronic diseases or aging . 
institutes will give the cihr new tools to support health research that are not available in the current granting - council structure - the medical research council . 
through institutes , the cihr will provide research in a specific scientific field to promote excellence and achievement . 
institutes will provide the opportunity to link and integrate research in different disciplines as part of a coordinated focus on a specific health issue . 
they will give the cihr the ability to identify national health needs and emerging critical health issues , and to develop strategies to link these priorities with research activities . 
institutes will give the public and other key stakeholders , through institute advisory boards , the opportunity to have direct input into research priority setting , and they will facilitate partnerships on strategic initiatives among the public sector , the health charities and the private sector . 
honourable senators , as outlined in the bill : 
the objective of the cihr is to excel , according to internationally accepted standards of scientific excellence , in the creation of new knowledge and its translation into improved health for canadians , more effective health services and products and a strengthened canadian health care system . 
this objective contains a key phrase - nationally accepted standards of scientific excellence . 
with cihr , as with the present system , these standards will be achieved through a process of peer review . 
all major extra - mural health research organizations rely on peer review . 
cihr will build on the excellent reputation already enjoyed by canada ' s existing peer review system . 
the provisional governing council of cihr is looking at the possibility of extending the peer review process in order to allow the participation of non - specialist members on peer review committees . 
the governing council will also have to promote innovation and risk - taking as part of the peer review process . 
in this way , the cihr will continue to enhance canada ' s reputation for excellence in health research . 
honourable senators , excellence in health research is all very well , but if the results of this research are not applied , then the question of excellence becomes solely academic . 
research findings can be translated into better practice of health care , helping to prevent , treat and cure diseases . 
they can be translated into a more efficient health care system that delivers services that will benefit all canadians . 
researchers in canada have already succeeded in creating our thriving health research environment . 
michael smith won the nobel prize for his contribution to our genetic understanding of diseases . 
leigh field has discovered two genes that produce susceptibility to juvenile diabetes , the most severe form of the disease . 
salim yusuf headed up a study that found that an anti - hypertensive drug called ramipril substantially improved survival after heart attack and lowered the risk of subsequent heart attacks . 
these findings could prevent 1 million premature deaths , heart attacks and strokes each year . 
the investment in the cihr is an investment in new knowledge about our health and our health care system , which will benefit all canadians . 
while this investment supports research in the academic community , the products of this investment will benefit us all . 
in the cycle of innovation that characterizes health research , research results can also lead to new research efforts . 
for example , the initial endowment of the research arm of the hospital for sick children in toronto is a direct result of the discovery of pablum , several decades ago , that has helped children in canada and throughout the world grow to be strong and healthy . 
a crucial challenge for establishing the cihr has been to have programs ready for the first year of its existence . 
the programming is now in place , administered by the existing granting councils until such time as the cihr is officially established . 
applications are already coming in and some awards have already been made . 
the response to these transition programs has been very encouraging , signalling that there is great potential for capacity building and willingness among researchers to work in collaborative research projects with the cihr . 
the success of these programs demonstrates the degree to which the entire research community is excited about the opportunities of the cihr and ready to take on the challenge of conducting health research in a new , more integrated and more targeted way . 
honourable senators , one of the most important decisions the minister of health will have to make in the weeks to come is who will direct this new organization . 
the new president and governing council must be individuals of the highest calibre , capable of commanding the respect of all who are involved with the cihr . 
nominations for these positions were actively sought , not only from stakeholders but also from the general public , because the cihr belongs to all canadians . 
when the president and members of the governing council are appointed , one of their first priorities will be to identify the first cihr institutes . 
this is no small task . 
institutes must meet the health care needs of canadians . 
they must have broad scope and the ability to excel in research and , finally , take various approaches to health research . 
the new governing council will not be starting from scratch . 
they will benefit from the best thinking of the health research community and input from the interim governing council , which has focused on how the interests of the health research community as a whole will best be served . 
having said that , honourable senators , i believe it is incumbent upon each and every one of us , during our deliberations on this bill , to give our best advice as to the future directions of these new research institutes . 
in my view , there are four areas of health research that have been seriously neglected in the past in canada . 
honourable senators , one - in - five canadians will suffer from mental illness in their lifetime . 
it may be a relatively light depression , easily treated , if treatment is indeed sought ; or it can be bipolar disease or schizophrenia , both of which can have lifelong effects . 
we know of the devastating impact that these diseases have on individuals and their families , but there are also enormous social costs . 
for example , many of the homeless in our society suffer from mental illness . 
yet we have done little health research in this country in the areas of causes , impacts and effects of mental illness . 
the new cihr offers us an excellent opportunity , which should not be missed . 
a second issue of concern in the health area is that of our aging population . 
honourable senators , the demographics in our country are changing . 
according to estimates by statistics canada , in 1998 there were over 400,000 people over the age of 85 . 
in 2041 , it is estimated that there will be over 1.6 million over the age of 85 in canada . 
we know that many will suffer from alzheimer ' s , dementia or other degenerative diseases . 
our aging population will put pressure on our health care system for palliative care beds , acute care beds , personal care homes and home care services . 
research is needed not only to seek a cure for these diseases but also to help us plan for these enormous changes . 
no one in this chamber , i know , would want us to neglect the very serious issue of aboriginal health . 
it is a serious form of diabetes that strikes the people in aboriginal communities , to some degree because of the quality of their housing and their lack of medical care . 
many of them suffer from renal failure . 
many of them require the removal of limbs . 
this is an intolerable situation and one that we must address . 
honourable senators , as a woman , i would not be fair to my gender if i did not mention the concern that many women have about our health . 
we also know that women who are infected by hiv are infected in different ways . 
women are the principal paid and unpaid caregivers in our society but the health consequences of this are poorly understood . 
there is no doubt in my mind that my mother died seven months after my father because she had spent the ten previous years looking after my father . 
we need to examine whether an institute on women ' s health is the way to go . 
is that the correct route ? 
perhaps another option is to have clear gender analysis in every single one of the institutes , gender analysis that will reflect the conditions of men and women . 
we hear a great deal in this chamber , and most eloquently recently by senator st. germain , about breast cancer . 
we do not hear nearly as much about prostate cancer . 
yet , if you polled the male senators and the spouses of female senators , you would find that prostate cancer is , in fact , a more frequent occurrence than breast cancer , because 1 in 8 men are affected by prostate cancer and only 1 in 9 women suffer from breast cancer . 
however , very little money is spent on prostate research in this country . 
honourable senators , even now in the planning phases of cihr , historic new relationships and partnerships are being established . 
meetings are being held among health research groups and organizations across the country . 
the ties are being created that will connect researchers from different disciplines and different areas of the country , that will bring together research funders and research users in cihr . 
hon. senators : 
hear , hear ! 
hon. wilbert j . keon : 
honourable senators , it is with a great sense of excitement and enthusiasm that i stand before you today to speak to bill c - 13 . 
the vision , values and principles upon which this bill has been drafted set the stage for the development of a renewed national research structure capable of being responsive to the changing realities and needs of the canadian population . 
the establishment of the canadian institutes of health research is an event of immense significance to the nation , an event that carries with it enormous potential and opportunity to build on this country ' s strong foundation of excellence in health research . 
the creation of the cihr will fundamentally and structurally transform the way research is conducted across this country . 
much of cihr ' s work will be built on a broad range of strong and cooperative partnerships . 
in effect , the institutes will move the support for health research beyond the confines of a traditional granting agency through a system of partnerships and alliances that will open up a range of new opportunities - opportunities that will shape the canadian research agenda and expand and enhance the impact of health care and health services research ; opportunities that will integrate the activities of researchers across the country who are focused on meeting common goals ; opportunities that will attract private - sector funding for research and help to expedite the commercialization of research results leading to health , economic and social benefits for all canadians ; opportunities that will speed the identification of new , more effective health discoveries , treatments and practices that will improve the health of canadians ; opportunities that will open up new avenues to translate and disseminate research findings into health care practice through improvements in health services , health service products and a strengthening of the health care system itself ; opportunities , my fellow senators , to enhance canada ' s competitiveness in the global economy , generating unforeseen economic opportunities and at the same time promoting excellence of canadian health research on an international stage . 
the federal government ' s contribution and funding for the financing of health research excellence in canadian hospitals , universities , health research centres and institutions will effectively be doubled . 
this time we will not just be looking at a simple increase in funding . 
instead , funding will flow into a well - designed , nationally integrated health research system that will maximize our human , intellectual and physical resources . 
as a result , it will provide a knowledge base for national health policy and superb health care for continuing our healthy nation . 
honourable senators , under bill c - 13 , the medical research council act will be repealed and 40 years of the existence of the medical research council will come to an end . 
indeed , i worked with and served on that council for 25 years , and , although i am sorry to see it go , i am truly excited about what has come in its place . 
the fact that this is being done with the full support of the mrc community in and of itself speaks strongly to the trust this community has in the vision and proposed structure of cihr . 
it has been a wonderful experience to see the medical , scientific , health care , academic , industrial and other communities come together to make the cihr a reality . 
the cihr concept emerged in 1998 from the work of a task force broadly representative of many diverse interests in health research . 
plans to proceed with the proposal of the task force were announced in the 1999 budget , which set aside an additional $ 225 million , over the current mrc funding , by the year 2001 - 2002 for the new cihr . 
bill c - 13 was tabled by the minister of health and received first reading in the other place on november 4 , 1999 . 
the cihr would take over from the mrc , as well as adopt a broader focus . 
it is , therefore , to be expected that the legislation for the cihr be more comprehensive than that of the mrc . 
most of bill c - 13 deals with the transfer of human resources , assets , liabilities and legal proceedings from the mrc to the cihr . 
in terms of the actual functioning of the cihr , the bill proposes that it would have several powers and functions additional to those of its predecessor . 
it should be noted that the mrc has , in fact , already undertaken to perform some of these additional powers and functions on its own ; however , the remaining powers and functions would set the cihr apart from the mrc . 
these functions would include working with the provinces as well as with the people and organizations both within and outside of canada , and keeping government and the public informed on issues of health and health research . 
in addition , the governor in council could assign to the cihr any other function necessary for that body to achieve its objective . 
there have been some concerns expressed about the administrative costs of the cihr . 
administrative costs are the basic costs of keeping the organization functional . 
they include the costs of the governing council , the president ' s office , core secretariat costs , including costs for financial and information systems and rents , and costs of managing and administering research programs . 
in the medical research council , these costs have been kept below 5 per cent of the total budget . 
in other agencies , such as the social sciences and humanities research council , these costs are about 8 per cent . 
the cihr is designed to be a transformative organization , and some additional strategic management investments will be needed to support that transformation . 
new institutes will be created that will focus on the health needs of canadians , and these will have scientific directors and small staffs . 
there will also be an emphasis on the translation of new knowledge into new clinical applications , health services and products . 
as a result , much better results for each resource dollar will accrue . 
there are two assurances that all expenses will be kept at a minimum . 
first , the research community itself is very vigilant , and it has proven that in the past . 
second , cihr estimates will come to the standing committee every year . 
there have also been some concerns raised about the appointment process . 
the process of appointments for the cihr president and the governing council has been remarkable in its openness and in the engagement of the canadian public . 
the traditional process is for the potential candidates to be both nominated and selected by the government . 
however , in the case of the cihr , there has been a process of public identification of suitable candidates for the leadership of the cihr . 
in december of 1999 , a public call for nominations was issued for both the president and governing council . 
respondents were encouraged to nominate candidates through either the submission of their curricula vitae or through a web - based application process . 
the response to this call for proposals was tremendous . 
over 450 high - quality nominations were received for these positions . 
following the nomination process , selection committees were established to significantly narrow down the list of candidates for the president and for the governing council . 
the committees were made up of outstanding leaders in research , presidents of universities , voluntary sector organizations and international research leaders . 
the committees , in essence , certified that the remaining candidates would meet the threshold of qualifications to hold the positions outlined in bill c - 13 . 
the recommendations of these committees have been transmitted to the government , which will make the final decisions upon proclamation of the cihr act . 
this unique process is substantially different than the appointment process for other federal organizations . 
it has engaged the community and has ensured that the best nominations for the canadian research community are included in the process . 
before i conclude , honourable senators , i wish to take this opportunity to recognize and pay tribute to the strong leadership of dr. henry friesen , chair and president of the mrc . 
indeed , i was with dr. friesen at the meeting of the medical research council that we hosted at the heart institute the night the concept was born and presented to minister rock . 
i must say his efforts were absolutely tireless and his genius shone throughout the entire process . 
honourable senators , it is with strong conviction and a great sense of pride that i support bill c - 13 and ask for your endorsement . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to and bill read second time . 
referred to committee 
on motion of senator carstairs , bill referred to the standing senate committee on social affairs , science and technology . 
payments in lieu of taxes bill 
second reading - debate adjourned 
honourable senators , i rise this evening to speak on second reading of bill c - 10 , the short title of which is the payments in lieu of taxes act . 
as a former municipal politician , i am pleased to be sponsoring this legislation on behalf of the government . 
bill c - 10 addresses a longstanding need to modernize the program by which municipal governments are compensated for the services they provide to federal facilities . 
this is a bill of good government that will strengthen the relationship between the government of canada and close to 2,000 local communities from coast to coast to coast . 
i am , therefore , hopeful that honourable senators will give this bill their unanimous support . 
we are all familiar with the large number and tremendous variety of facilities operated by the government of canada across the country . 
these parliament buildings are perhaps the most recognized and best known of these facilities , but there are many others . 
the government of canada owns office buildings in provincial and territorial capitals and other municipalities throughout canada . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , that i not see the clock for another hour ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
senator moore : 
the government of canada also operates wharves , docks , airports , penitentiaries , museums , interpretative centres in national parks and recreational facilities . 
the government of canada maintains defence establishments , court buildings , historic sites , and the list goes on . 
virtually all of these facilities place demands on the municipal service infrastructure - demands for water and sewer services , road maintenance , waste disposal , public transit , and so on . 
the government of canada has a moral obligation to pay a reasonable portion of the costs of these services to ensure that federal facilities are an asset at the community level rather than a liability . 
yet , honourable senators are no doubt aware that the government of canada is exempt from local taxation under section 125 of the constitution act , 1867 . 
in order to protect this important constitutional principle while paying its fair share of the cost of local services , for the past 50 years the government of canada has been paying municipalities grants in lieu of taxes . 
the program is managed by the department of public works and government services , and it has worked very well for many years , serving the interests of municipalities and the government of canada alike . 
payments in lieu of taxes to municipalities now exceed $ 375 million annually . 
this money is helping local communities maintain or improve services and support economic development . 
it brings a tangible federal presence and influence to the communities that receive it . 
however , as is the case with all good programs , there is room for improvement . 
many far - reaching changes have been made in municipal taxation regimes over the past 20 years , changes that have resulted in significant increases in payments in lieu of taxes for federal properties . 
while the government has an obligation to pay its share of the cost of municipal services , it must also protect the broad interests of federal taxpayers by avoiding excessive program costs . 
with that in mind , honourable senators , i believe that bill c - 10 strikes an excellent balance of fairness , equity , and predictability in the management of federal payments in lieu of taxes . 
its goal is not to subvert the existing approach but to build on it for the new millennium . 
let me quickly explain the key elements of bill c - 10 , which is intended to ensure that federal payments in lieu of taxes are as much like the taxes levied against private landowners as possible while still recognizing the government ' s constitutional exemption from local taxation . 
perhaps the most obvious impact of bill c - 10 is that it will change the name of the legislation and of the program itself . 
in future , we will use the terminology " payments in lieu of taxes " instead of " grants in lieu of taxes . " 
this is not merely a superficial change , honourable senators . 
it implies a more explicit and respectful relationship between the two levels of government and indicates that the government of canada is accepting the same responsibilities as are other property owners . 
this change in name is underscored by a goodwill clause inbill c - 10 that states the government ' s commitment to fairness and equity and the administration of federal payments in lieu of taxes . 
substantive changes in the legislation include a requirement that the government of canada pay a supplementary amount to a municipality when a payment is unreasonably delayed . 
this will encourage federal departments and agencies to meet the payment schedules put in place locally , ensuring more equitable treatment of municipalities . 
the minister of public works and government services will have the sole discretion to decide whether or not a payment was late , and has already indicated that he will be seeking a high level of compliance by federal property holders . 
bill c - 10 will also improve the fairness of the process by establishing in law a dispute advisory panel through which municipalities can challenge federal decisions on payments in lieu of taxes . 
the federation of canadian municipalities and municipal assessment authorities will be consulted on the makeup of the panel . 
the proposed legislation includes a new discretionary power that allows the minister of public works and government services to make payments in lieu of taxes on tenant - occupied property when the minister is convinced that the municipality has made reasonable efforts to collect from the tenant . 
another notable change is the expanded definition of " real property " contained in bill c - 10 . 
this means that , in future , such structures as employee parking lots , outdoor swimming pools , and golf courses , which are currently excluded from the legislation , will be subject to making payments . 
this proposed legislation also ensures that first nations governments will have the same access to federal payments in lieu of taxes as do other taxing authorities . 
to this end , the amendments contained in bill c - 10 will address certain barriers that limit the ability of first nations to take advantage of these payments in their quest for greater financial independence . 
honourable senators should also be aware that the government of canada is undertaking administrative changes to the municipal payments program that are not part of bill c - 10 . 
for example , a program advisory council will be established to advise the minister of public works and government services on administrative and policy issues related to the management of the payments in lieu of taxes program . 
as well , public works and government services canada has engaged national professional appraisal associations to draft best practices for unusual types of federal properties , such as penitentiaries , airports , defence establishments , and national parks . 
the goal is to reduce the number of valuation disputes related to these properties and to ensure consistent valuation treatment of similar properties across canada . 
honourable senators , bill c - 10 is simply confirming that the government of canada respects the standards set for other property owners , that it values the services it receives from municipal governments , and that it is committed to being a responsible property owner and a conscientious member of the community . 
i mentioned at the outset that bill c - 10 responds to a longstanding need to reform the grants in lieu of taxes program and legislation . 
in fact , bill c - 10 culminates several years of review and discussion . 
many of the provisions originate from a joint technical committee of representatives from the federation of canadian municipalities , the treasury board secretariat , and public works and government services canada . 
the committee was established in 1995 and has produced two reports . 
other suggestions were put forth by municipal leaders , appraisal professionals , and other stakeholders who met with the minister of public works and government services during a series of 11 round table discussions held in the summer of 1998 . these meetings took place in major centres across canada . 
at stop after stop , the minister was told that the municipal payments program is crucially important to local communities , that it bolsters the relationship between the government of canada and the municipalities , and that it can and should be strengthened . 
on behalf of the municipalities who depend on this program , and in the interests of fairness , equity , and predictability , i would ask honourable senators to heed that message today and support bill c - 10 . 
on motion of senator atkins , for senator grimard , debate adjourned . 
canada business corporations act 
canada cooperatives act 
bill to amend - second reading - debate continued 
on the order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the honourable senator kirby , seconded by the honourable senator cook , for the second reading of bill s - 19 , to amend the canada business corporations act and the canada cooperatives act and to amend other acts in consequence . 
hon. dan hays ( deputy leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , i know that senator wilson wishes to speak to this order . 
however , i observe that senator tkachuk is the member opposite officially responding on this bill and , as such , he is entitled to a 45 - minute time allocation . 
i would ask honourable senators for leave for that time allocation to be reserved to him , even though senator wilson speaks now on this bill . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
is leave granted , honourable senators . 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
hon. lois m. wilson : 
honourable senators , i wish to speak briefly to bill s - 19 , particularly on clause 137 ( 5 ) ( b ) ( 1 ) . 
my interest is motivated by an increasing awareness that canada needs to look carefully at the relationship between corporate social responsibility and investment , particularly internationally , and the role of shareholders in corporations . 
the bill , as amended , is a vast improvement on the former bill and i support it . 
it encourages and allows shareholders to communicate more freely with each other and with corporations . 
it greatly expands the rights of shareholders . 
however , while i welcome the proposed amendment that requires a company to circulate proposals from beneficial shareholders and to amend the act so as not to narrow the grounds for a company to exclude a shareholder proposal , i have some concerns . 
honourable senators , i believe that bill s - 19 could be detrimental to shareholder issues on corporate responsibility that some small shareholders may wish to raise . 
for example , christian brothers investment services , inc. , in new york , although supportive of the main direction of the bill , as am i , has this to say : 
yet , talisman energy refused to circulate a proposal in 1999 on the grounds that the proposal was submitted for political , religious , social or similar cause . 
retaining the corporate social responsibility exclusion without establishing a right of administrative appeal is , in my judgment , not wise . 
small minority shareholders who may have a genuine interest and concern that could properly be the subject matter of a shareholder proposal but whose proposals have been excluded will likely not be able to have the resources to fight their exclusion in the courts . 
the inclusion of the phrase " unless the person who submits the proposal demonstrates that the proposal relates in a significant way to the business or affairs of the corporation " to the tail end of the present corporate social responsibility exclusion is positive only if it is made clear that the initial onus is on the corporation to justify the exclusion . 
otherwise , the company holds all the power and the shareholder is at its mercy . 
moreover , if the social responsibility exclusion is retained , the shareholding and time holding requirements must be removed . 
otherwise , small shareholders will face a two - pronged test to bring forward shareholder proposals . 
if social responsibility is excluded , then minimum shareholding and time holding requirements are appropriate . 
honourable senators , much effort has gone into meeting concerns that a more open process would lead to abuse by shareholders , but these concerns need to be revisited for the sake of responsible small shareholders . 
according to documents obtained from industry canada through the access to information act , eliminating the present corporate responsibility exclusion was supported by a number of smaller , socially responsible investment groups . 
it was opposed by the larger corporations such as the coalition on cbca reform , imperial oil , nova corporation , osler hoskin and harcourt , and transalta corporation . 
to be small is not necessarily to be irresponsible . 
i hope that the senate committee examining this bill will indeed give the bill serious sober second thought in its deliberations in order to demonstrate more equitable access by all the shareholders . 
some hon. senators : 
hear , hear ! 
on motion of senator deware , for senator tkachuk , debate adjourned . 
financing of post - secondary education 
inquiry - debate continued 
on the order : 
resuming debate on the inquiry of the honourable senator atkins calling the attention of the senate to the financing of post - secondary education in canada and particularly that portion of the financing that is borne by students , with a view to developing policies that will address and alleviate the debt load which post - secondary students are being burdened with in canada . - ( 
honourable senator callbeck ) . 
hon. catherine s . callbeck : 
honourable senators , it is a pleasure to rise today and participate in the debate on this inquiry . 
i first wish to thank senator atkins for bringing it to the floor of the chamber . 
this issue has not been formally debated in this house since the special senate committee on post - secondary education presented its final report in december 1997 . 
however , i do not believe that there can be any doubt in the minds of honourable senators about the significance of this issue . 
debt loads are increasing mainly because students are now required to pay a greater portion toward the cost of their education . 
that question is difficult to answer , for it attempts to find out why individuals decide to pursue higher education . 
it is known from various studies that such a decision is complex and involves a variety of motivations and barriers . 
therefore , the predominant view appears to be that while the cost of studies and debt load are definitely problematic , most students do not see that cost as reason enough to give up their studies after high school . 
in other words , given the choice of incurring debt or not attending a post - secondary institute , the majority of students seem prepared to incur the debt and pay what it takes to position themselves for better employment opportunities in the future . 
students appear to view post - secondary education for what it is - an investment in themselves and in their future . 
how does the prospect of large amounts of debt affect the decision of a student from a low - income background ? 
do tuition fees and student debt have any impact on accessibility ? 
in its report to this chamber , the special senate committee on post - secondary education also asked that question . 
it recommended that the federal government and the council of ministers of education canada evaluate the effect that the prospect of high debt has on accessibility . 
these two parties made a joint announcement in november of 1999 highlighting their intention to conduct such a study . 
unfortunately , the results are not yet available . 
however , the maritime provinces higher education commission conducted a similar study and published its results in october 1997 . 
it found that there was a growing debt problem among the maritime student population but that high levels of debt did not , in general , deter students from studies beyond high school . 
however , they did find that the weight of student debt was unequally borne by those in less fortunate financial situations . 
this study found that 52 per cent of students in the maritimes from lower - income families stated that they would have second thoughts about higher education as a result of debt concerns . 
only 29 per cent of students from middle - to high - income families had the same concern . 
these figures , honourable senators , are of concern , for all the relevant data points to the fact that one of the best ways to get out of poverty , or to improve your income situation , is through education . 
therefore , if high debt levels are seen by some as a barrier to post - secondary education , something must be done to alleviate this and , in turn , to encourage all young people to pursue higher education . 
for , if nothing is done , we will be creating a society of haves and have - nots , the haves being those who can afford financially to pursue higher education , and the have - nots being those who feel they cannot . 
we are now at a time when an undergraduate or college degree has become a minimum standard of employment in many areas . 
this is due , in part , to the shift in the focus of our economy . 
as a result , education is becoming even more crucial , not just for individuals but for society as a whole . 
the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , underscored this in their 1996 report entitled " lifelong learning for all , " when they said : 
education plays a critical role in $ raising the skills and competencies of the population , thereby improving the capacity of people to live , work and learn well . 
a well educated and well - trained labour force is critical to the social and economic well being of countries . 
all this is not to say that canada is not doing an excellent job in providing for the education of its citizens . 
on the contrary , canada ' s emergence as a highly educated society is not new . 
our standards , already high by international comparisons , improved substantially during the 1990 s . 
according to a report released on monday , march 21 , 2000 , by statistics canada , more young people than ever before graduated from high school , and more of these graduates went on to higher education . 
in 1990 , 20 per cent of people aged 25 to 29 in canada had less than high school education . 
canada also does well under international comparisons . 
as you can see , honourable senators , canada continues to be ahead of the curve in terms of educating our citizens . 
however , because of climbing student debt loads , as well as an increase in the loan default rates , we are failing some students , namely , those who opt not to attend because they feel they cannot afford to , and others who have difficulty with repayment after graduation . 
therefore , the solution should focus on providing students with more options and flexibility when repaying their debt , with particular provisions geared to those in disadvantaged situations , so as to ensure accessibility . 
the federal government and the provinces have begun to introduce such methods . 
in 1998 , the canadian opportunities strategy was introduced in the federal budget . 
there were a variety of new measures to help manage student debt , including : tax relief for interest on all student loans ; extension of interest relief after graduation ; extended repayment periods for those who need it ; a reduction in the loan principal for those who are still in financial difficulty ; and finally , millennium scholarships . 
these measures have ensured that hundreds of thousands of students have had an easier time with respect to repayment . 
furthermore , they also answer some of the recommendations made by the special senate committee . 
provincial governments have also instituted programs to assist students with their debt . 
these are in the form of loan remission programs . 
a loan remission is a grant awarded to students upon successful graduation . 
these amounts vary by province . 
for example , in my own province of prince edward island , on any amount borrowed over $ 6,000 , up to a maximum of $ 2,000 per year is forgiven . 
these programs are positive initiatives , and they should be built upon . 
unfortunately , it is too early to assess what impact they have had on accessibility . 
however , given today ' s default rate of one in three , it appears that some students are falling through the cracks . 
i would like to see a system where loan payments are tied to a student ' s starting salary , and then adjusted accordingly with salary increases as career and experience grow . 
in addition , i think loans should be awarded interest - free status for a fixed period of time after graduation . 
a similar system is presently in use in australia , and it appears to be working well . 
in order to counteract fraud and save administration costs , payments , pegged to a person ' s annual income , are collected through the income tax system . 
i would like to see a system that would continue to enable young people in every province to reach beyond high school toward higher levels of learning if they so choose . 
in order to assist those who may not attend because the fees are high , i suggest a fixed period of interest relief , greater loan remission payments , and flexible repayment options , including loan payments tied to a student ' s salary . 
these initiatives would further demonstrate our belief in our students and our confidence in their futures in the knowledge - based economy . 
honourable senators , the challenge is to build on the system that we have , to develop a coordinated , equitable framework for the financing of post - secondary education across canada so that every student who chooses can go on to higher levels of learning after high school . 
hon. norman k . atkins : 
honourable senators , would the honourable senator callbeck entertain a question ? 
senator callbeck : 
of course , honourable senators . 
senator atkins : 
we all have our own solutions to the problems of student debt . 
senator callbeck : 
i do not know what the honourable senator means by that . 
is he saying that they should be able to attend free of charge ? 
senator atkins : 
i am talking about some form of financial support . 
senator callbeck : 
yes , i think there should be some form of financial support . 
however , it is obvious that some students were not accommodated . 
as i mentioned , various initiatives were undertaken by the federal government in the 1998 budget , but it is too early to know how many students will be affected . 
however , there will probably be thousands of students to whom those initiatives will be helpful in paying down their debt . 
in answer to your question , yes , i think some students are falling through the cracks and we could be doing more . 
senator atkins : 
the statistics that i have show that almost 1 million students now qualify for post - secondary education in one form or another and 300,000 are in a situation where they need financial support . 
there seems to be a problem with many of those 300,000 . 
whether they have the opportunity to proceed is questionable . 
that is an incredible amount of debt for anyone to carry . 
is it possible to provide grants so that students can receive some support ? 
repayment of that loan would then take effect only after the student graduated and began a permanent job . 
furthermore , there should be some period of grace before a student would have to pay back that loan with interest . 
senator callbeck : 
that is what i suggested . 
the payment should be geared to the salary . 
there should be a fixed period of time before interest begins to accumulate on the debt . 
having said that , the government has taken great initiatives along this line to assist our students . 
that is being done at present by the provincial ministers and the human resources department , which announced that study in november of 1999 . it will be interesting to see those results . 
senator atkins : 
senator callbeck : 
i was happy to see the government take that initiative . 
it is now at $ 3,000 . 
it may be that the figure should be higher , but let us see how it works out . 
on motion of senator graham , debate adjourned . 
religious freedom in china in relation to united nations international covenants 
inquiry - debate continued 
on the order : 
resuming debate on the inquiry of the honourable senator wilson calling the attention of the senate to religious freedom in china , in relation to the un international covenants . - ( 
honourable senator andreychuk ) . 
hon. a . raynell andreychuk : 
honourable senators , i am pleased to note that the inquiry of which senator wilson gave notice on november 17 , 1999 , led to an interesting debate in this chamber . 
i should like to add some of my own comments . 
as could be expected , senators austin , di nino and poy have enlarged the debate beyond the scope of senator wilson ' s inquiry and into such issues as human rights and trade and the so - called asian values debate . 
in debating human rights and trade and asian values , i wish to reiterate some of the points i made in my speech on thursday , may 13 , 1999 , in addressing that senate report . 
with respect to human rights and trade , professor brian job of the institute of international relations , university of british columbia , pointed out : 
the basic argument in my remarks is that we canadians in academic , government and private sectors cannot simply define our relationship $ in narrow economic terms , that is , as jobs , jobs , jobs and trade , trade , trade . 
i argue that if we do define our foreign policy and our bilateral relations with asia solely in economic terms , we would be myopic because we will eventually undermine our economic interests and our success in the region . 
he went on to state : 
increasingly , canada will find that its economic interests have social , political and security implications . 
further , page 105 of the senate report reads as follows : 
the committee believes that the dichotomy between trade and human rights is a false one in the sense that the two entities are interwoven . 
what is coming to be realized by governments , policy makers , and businesses alike is that the usual acceptance of the rule of law , the outlawing of corrupt practices , respect for workers ' rights , high health and safety standards , and sensitivity to the environment are not only morally justifiable ; they are good for business . 
by promoting and complying with human rights , a country fosters the political and consumer stability for economic prosperity and the fulfilment of trade commitments . 
business also has an important role to play , both in human - rights promotion and in ensuring that it itself does not contribute to abuses . 
the committee then went on to state that canada should not " leave its human rights values at the door " in its commercial and other dealings with countries . 
effectively , the committee - and i concur - stated that economics does not come first and human rights second , that they go hand in hand . 
recommendation 18 in the senate report states : 
that canadian foreign policy include the following group of principles as a minimum requirement in enunciating a clear stance on human rights : 
- adherence to the universal declaration of human rights is the responsibility of all states . 
as such , canada has the responsibility to encourage asia pacific countries to adhere to and comply with the international human rights declarations and , in particular , instruments that they have signed . 
- canada has an important role to play in assisting its asia pacific partners in boosting their reform efforts and fostering their human rights capacity to develop their own human rights strategies . 
canada should foster multilateral , regional and bilateral dialogues with other countries to draw them more fully into the international human rights system ... 
i shall come back to this point in a moment . 
the second aspect that i should like to address is the misleading asian mystique that somehow makes us think of the asian countries and china in particular as different from all others . 
surely , every country , including those in africa , in south america and elsewhere , has its own unique history , culture and background . 
why is it that we have little difficulty in forcefully raising human rights issues in countries in africa and south america , and indeed in the former soviet union , but we are reticent to do so in asia - pacific and , more important , in china ? 
size seems to be the answer . 
however , from a human dimension , surely the life of an individual in china is equal to and as important as any life in africa or canada . 
we must be reminded that the universal declaration of human rights is a declaration for peoples and not for nations . 
minister axworthy himself recently made that point in his quest for the new human security agenda . 
he has pointed out that there are two cornerstones in the united nations , one being the declaration , which is a declaration protecting individuals , while national sovereignty is the basis of the charter . 
his inclination - and i would have thought to be , on the side of the individual in the protection of their rights - is the right one irrespective of the country in which they find themselves . 
this asian - values debate has certainly lessened since the asian financial crisis . 
prior to that , as our report indicated , it was an excuse not to make the changes required . 
as we pointed out in our report : 
the asian financial crises in 1997 has proven that there is no mystique in asia - pacific , or put another way , that asian countries have found no way around the usual economic forces and rules . 
the only country that seems reluctant is china . 
we should note that , while there have been economic gains in china and while china has made remarkable progress in opening its markets and other institutions , china still has the largest army in the world , with wealth being siphoned off for weapons . 
the real need is to encourage de - escalation . 
as a subpoint to this , i find it troubling that , every time human rights is raised as an issue for analysis in china , some individuals jump to the conclusion that sanctions are being suggested and state that sanctions are much more destructive than dialogue . 
first , i am inclined to agree that constructive dialogue is better than isolation through sanctions , but it is not an either / or situation . 
dialogue must , in fact , be constructive and it must produce results . 
otherwise , it is merely a facade to ignore human rights and to deflect from the real agenda . 
further , there is a whole host of measures between constructive dialogue and sanctions that should be utilized . 
many of them are existing mechanisms within the international community and , therefore , it is a disservice to balkanize the debate . 
senator poy has laid out her analysis of asian values , reminding us of our own poor record in the past on human rights and indicating that the collectivity argument has weight . 
i can only state over and over again my belief that the universal declaration of human rights embodies principles , values and rights that are , in fact , universal in nature and not unique to the western world . 
this is why i have been very conscious not to accept the government ' s position that we are projecting our values abroad . 
rather , i personally subscribe to the policy of furthering the universal values to which china agreed when it entered the united nations ; and , while not yet ratified , they have gone so far as to sign the two main covenants . 
i , for one , am not an expert on asian values , and do not presume to be one . 
however , i turn to some eminent sources who put out the alternate position . 
professor amitav acharya , associate professor at the department of political science at york university and also professor at the university of toronto / york university joint centre for asia - pacific studies , has responded to the question of asian values and human rights by stating : 
my definition of human rights is rights that every person enjoys simply by being human . 
there are no cultural conditions attached to this . 
we just have to make sure that political authorities do not abuse it . 
amartya sen , winner of the 1998 nobel prize for economic science , the author of development as freedom : 
i believe him to be well versed in understanding the human dimension of this issue . 
he states : 
confucius is the standard author quoted in interpreting asian values ... confucius 
himself did not recommend blind allegiance to the state . 
when zilu asks him " how to serve a prince , " confucius replies - 
here , mr. sen adds , in brackets , that this is a statement that the censors of authoritarian regimes may want to ponder . 
` tell him the truth even if it offends him . ' 
confucius is not averse to practical caution and tact , but does not forego the recommendation to oppose a bad government ( tactfully , if necessary ) : ` when the ( good ) way prevails in the state , speak boldly and act boldly . 
when the state has lost the way , act boldly and speak softly . ' 
indeed , confucius provides a clear pointer to the fact that the two pillars of the imagined edifice of asian values , loyalty to the family and obedience to the state , can be in severe conflict with each other . 
many advocates of the power of ` asian values ' see the role of the state as an extension of the role of the family , but as confucius noted , there can be tension between the two . 
the governor of she told confucius , ` among my people , there is a man of unbending integrity : when his father stole a sheep , he denounced him . ' 
to this confucius replied , ` among my people , men of integrity do things differently : a father covers up for his son , a son covers up for his father - and there is integrity in what to do . ' 
( 1950 ) 
finally , i quote ms maureen o ' neill , president , at the time , of the international centre of the human rights and democratic development centre when she testified before a committee and stated : 
it has become increasingly clear that issues of trade and investment ought not to be discussed in isolation from human rights and democracy . 
ms o ' neill further stated that the ideas of human rights , as being translated to us through apec members , were not the ideas of the citizenry but were really the ideas of the leaders , and that the fundamental values that we call human rights were being echoed in those countries . 
therefore , i ask if it is really asian values that preclude discussion of human rights , or is it the strategy of leaders to maintain absolute control for the purpose of their own position rather than for the benefit and welfare of the citizenry ? 
i now turn to the issue of religious freedom in china . 
i commend senator wilson for her initiative in working with her counterparts in china and for the assessments that both she and her counterparts have made . 
while she rightly points out that she saw no evidence of widespread intentional policy to persecute religious groups , i think she would agree that the broader picture is not one that her committee could justifiably analyze . 
in rereading senator wilson ' s remarks , i would at some later date ask what is meant by the term " main - line christian churches in canada , " and what she would mean by the " highly privatized orientation of religious groups originating in los angeles or taiwan . " 
further , while i am on this train , i have some difficulty in referring to cults and then accepting the notion that not only are the falun gong a cult but that they are a destabilizing , harmful and foreign - influenced organization . 
it would have been more helpful if there was some evidence from senator wilson ' s counterparts as to how they came to this conclusion . 
succinctly stated , the issue of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the universal declaration of human rights , as is the freedom of association . 
an attempt by any government to sanction churches , in my view , is inappropriate , and the key to china ' s problems lies in the fact that it has recognized only five religions . 
i think i have at least identified the issue that it is not a question of individuality versus collectivity but rather whether the principle of collectivity is being manipulated by the government in such a way as to control the citizens . 
to rely very exclusively , or indeed heavily , on those churches that are functioning openly and sanctioned by the government is questionable . 
china still holds itself out to be a communist country but with some openness for the economy . 
we know now , but only after the soviet union collapsed , of the true difficulties that churches and believers faced under the soviet system , and i believe it is a fair parallel to draw . 
under the communist system , and i can use ukraine as an example , there was the officially sanctioned orthodox church , the orthodox church that went underground , and the orthodox church that went into exile . 
even that church which functioned and was accepted to be one of the patriotic churches is now finally opening up to reveal what compromises were made for survival . 
i can only believe that some day in china the same will happen . 
while the communist government did not try to eliminate religious beliefs , it did create churches for both catholics and protestants as well as three other government - sanctioned churches free from any links with foreign governments . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
i regret to inform the honourable senator that her speaking time has expired . 
are you seeking leave to continue ? 
senator andreychuk : 
i am seeking leave to continue . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
is leave granted , honourable senators ? 
hon. senators : 
senator andreychuk : 
honourable senators . 
i will try to be as brief as i can . 
in other words , they acknowledged five churches with stipulations . 
however unwelcome this may have been to many protestants , i point out it certainly put the catholics on a collision course , as the all - important ties with the pope were at stake . 
in fact , the recently deceased ignatius cardinal gong spent 30 years in chinese prisons and labour camps for refusing to endorse a patriotic catholic church . 
his struggle , it has been noted , was the concern for the proper source of authority in religious belief under a totalitarian government determined to mould the beliefs of its citizens and extract public affirmations of loyalty . 
one must not forget the struggle for all those prisoners of conscience who were imprisoned in the name of their faith , though it is true that china has changed course several times since then . 
in my opinion , even the so - called recognized churches can not be taken as the sole source of determination of religious freedom , and particularly it would be unfair to put them in that kind of spotlight as their own security could be prejudiced . 
therefore , there is a delicate balance of encouraging these groups while not making them the spokespersons for the issue of religious freedom totally in china . 
it is , therefore , necessary for all of us to look at other sources . 
despite what china has stated with respect to the falun gong , for example , as being a destabilizing and harmful foreign - influenced organization , there has been no factual evidence presented . 
the whole concept of falun gong practitioners must be reviewed . 
certainly , international opinion supports that the falun gong practitioners have not violated any real laws and that the worst case scenario would be that perhaps some have resorted to civil disobedience to fight the government ' s claim that they are a cult of destabilization . 
there is certainly evidence that a crackdown has occurred , not only on the falun gong but on tibetan monks and buddhists particularly . 
i would encourage senator wilson and the other canadian members to contact the falun gong to hear their side of the story and to seek the opinion of a whole host of legitimate and recognized non - governmental activities familiar with china and the state . 
one must look at the broader issue of freedom of expression , association and religion and rely on independent groups who have access to china and who have a credible reputation . 
i personally place lesser weight on the united states ' human rights report , for obvious reasons , but do rely very heavily on human rights organizations such as amnesty international , human rights watch and others who reported that torture and ill treatment continues to be commonplace . 
in the words of the secretary general of amnesty international : 
last year was unquestionably the most repressive year in china since the horrifying massacre at tiananmen square ten years earlier . 
something must be done . 
further , former liberal cabinet minister warren allmand , director of the international centre for human rights and development , has said , as reported in the ottawa citizen : 
canada is undermining the multilateral efforts to affect change in china , by pursuing its own bilateral efforts . 
he says it is prime minister jean chr é tien ' s single - minded approach to boosting trade that has watered down canada ' s previously harder line on chinese human rights abuses . 
he goes on to state : 
we think many of these things are probably decided in the prime minister ' s office and probably not in the department of foreign affairs . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
honourable senators , is it your wish that i not see the clock for another hour ? 
hon. dan hays ( deputy leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , not having seen the clock for two hours and it now being 8 o ' clock , i can interpret that two ways , i guess . 
i sense a certain restlessness in the house , and perhaps the latter interpretation would be the better approach . 
shall we allow senator andreychuk to complete her remarks ? 
hon. no ë l a . kinsella ( deputy leader of the opposition ) : 
honourable senators , i suggest that we not see the clock and go through the order paper today , because there may be more restlessness , should it be suggested that we must come back here friday morning . 
if we continue and finish the order paper today , it may help us greatly later this week in terms of the schedule . 
hon. eymard g . corbin : 
honourable senators , there must be a sense of fairness in extending time . 
we were originally told that we would continue until seven o ' clock . 
it is now eight o ' clock and 23 seconds . 
we try to plan our lifestyles in a way in which we can maintain decent health while working these abnormal hours . 
it is enough to have sandwiches at noon - hour , and in committee or caucus meetings ; it is pretty tough to have sandwiches again in the evening . 
at my age , i cannot take that too often . 
i know that the press will make fun of this , but i do not give a damn about the press . 
they are never here anyhow . 
all i want is that we be able to manage our time such that we can plan our lives in a decent way , as everyone else does . 
this is no way to run a shop . 
i attach a great deal of importance to progress of legislation , but surely other things can wait . 
i do not wish to be unfair to senator andreychuk . 
she believes absolutely in human rights , but this is not the first instance that she has spoken to us about human rights , and i am sure we will hear more speeches on the topic . 
however , is it justifiable to continue to speak about human rights at this time of the day ? 
why did we not adjourn at six o ' clock and come back at eight o ' clock ? 
so what if we sit on friday ? 
i am not against a five - day or six - day week . 
however , let us have a lifestyle that enhances our health rather than being a detriment to it . 
hon. lois m. wilson : 
honourable senators , i have an inquiry on sudan on the notice paper to which i wanted to speak last tuesday . 
it has not been possible to speak to it because we have run out of time each day , and apparently we are running out of time again . 
my next opportunity to speak to this will be when we reconvene after our break in may , which is fine . 
sudan will not go away . 
however , i need direction on this because i was to speak to it tonight . 
senator hays : 
i have commented on the restlessness of the house , as has senator kinsella . 
i do not know how senator corbin is disposed on this . 
we are sitting with leave . 
if leave is not granted , the house will automatically adjourn . 
senator corbin : 
senator hays knows that he can always count on me . 
i am one of the senators who is always here . 
senator hays : 
therefore , i would ask for leave to complete our routine of business . 
the hon. the speaker pro tempore : 
is leave granted , honourable senators ? 
hon. senators : 
agreed . 
senator andreychuk : 
i thank the honourable senators , and particularly senator corbin , for those comments . 
i have spoken previously on human rights and i will continue to speak on this subject , as i feel strongly about it . 
i beg the indulgence of honourable senators one more time because i think there is some merit in proceeding now . 
i strongly support mr. irwin cotler , a liberal member of parliament , and a coalition of 11 human rights groups in canada that called on canada to express concern about china ' s behaviour in the human rights commission . 
therefore , it is clearly the prime minister of canada who must take the initiative to join forces with other like - minded countries in supporting a resolution expressing concern . 
after all , the present resolution that is circulating , which will probably be put to the human rights commission this week , is not a condemning resolution , but rather one expressing concern and encouragement . 
if china is truly interested in working cooperatively and adhering to its obligations , and if china were truly interested in a dialogue on human rights , it would not be lobbying , as we speak , to continue only the pleasant sounding but ineffectual rights dialogue . 
if canada is not prepared to accept the united states resolution , it could put forward one of its own . 
simply to continue to indicate that they are constructively engaged is not working and is not sufficient . 
therefore , it is not only china that has something to account for , but also canada . 
in our report on the asia - pacific region , we clearly stated that it was canada ' s responsibility to encourage her partners to adhere to international human rights instruments , as we are obliged to do so . 
to continue to buy time for china in constructive engagement and to talk about the long - term solutions by virtue of other means has not borne fruit but is jeopardizing the human security of many citizens in canada . 
would you have the same patience ? 
the prime minister should not lead another team canada delegation to china this year without first advising the chinese government that human rights would be a high and concurrent agenda . 
i apologize if this statement was long . 
i wanted to cover the points that are important . 
i urge the government and members opposite , who have some influence , to join with mr. cotler to see whether we can make a difference in the lives of individuals in china . 
on motion of senator kinsella , debate adjourned . 
sudan 
inquiry - debate adjourned 
hon. lois m. wilson rose pursuant to notice of march 21 , 2000 : 
that she will call the attention of the senate to the situation in the sudan . 
hon. lois m. wilson : 
honourable senators , a year ago , on march 23 , 1999 , i initiated an inquiry on the situation in sudan , with an update on december 7 , 1999 . my initial inquiry gave much of the background of the current conflict , and i encourage any who will be speaking to this inquiry to refer to that intervention . 
either allegation could be the subject of an inquiry on its own . 
the international community has not given attention commensurate with the enormity of human suffering taking place . 
what attention there is has been focused almost exclusively on oil extraction and not on the current peace strategies for this wartorn country . 
while for some stopping the flow of oil would be a giant step toward peace - although that is based on the premise that international sanctions would have to be in place as malaysia and china own large shares in the pipeline - a significant body of opinion thinks that other aspects of the situation of sudan have not been fully enough explored . 
it is those aspects i wish to raise . 
canada supports the formal process of peace negotiations between the government of sudan and the southern people ' s liberation army , spla , presently being brokered by special envoy daniel mboya and his secretariat , acting on behalf of the regional african initiative called the intergovernmental authority on development , igad . 
igad was formed in the early 1990 s by african countries that wanted to get at the root of the conflict . 
beginning on the premise of underdevelopment , it then began to focus efforts on a peace process for the sudan . 
currently , western countries , including canada , fund the igad secretariat through cida and support its work diplomatically through the international partners forum , ipf , where i represent canada . 
the 1994 declaration of principles , the only document agreed to by both warring parties , constitutes the basis for the resolution of the conflict in sudan . 
it is on the basis of these principles that current peace negotiations are being conducted . 
two negotiation sessions have taken place , with a third scheduled for april . 
my recent visit to the horn of africa left me cautiously optimistic about the igad process . 
at least the framework for an agreement exists and the envoys from neighbouring countries have been active since the beginning of this year . 
honourable senators , to say that things did not go smoothly in the negotiations so far is the understatement of the year . 
two major issues seem intractable : the separation of religion and the state , which the government of sudan has not yet accepted given its strong islamic orientation , and the right of the south to self - determination should agreement on the unity of the country fail . 
dispute persists on the geographic borders between north and south , particularly as to the status of " marginalized territories , " abyei , the southern kordafan , and the south blue nile . 
moreover , the government has begun to insist that igad is confined strictly to the south and that the issues of the territories under dispute must take place apart from the igad table . 
after the last round of negotiations , the spla , out of frustration , no doubt , announced that it will move directly to an interim arrangement before self - determination , which would probably mean the separation of the south from the north . 
if this happens , it will leave unanswered all the issues for a comprehensive peace . 
it must be noted , however , that spla has agreed to a third round of negotiations . 
we have always said that the sudan situation is extremely complex , and now we are beginning to appreciate that fact . 
libya and egypt have decided that igad has taken too long to work , and have proposed a parallel peace initiative , which unfortunately does not recognize the declaration of principles , particularly the clause on self - determination for the south , should efforts at unity fail . 
egypt is suggesting a national reconciliation process with or without igad . 
although this runs the danger of recognizing a horizontal northern arab solidarity that will further exclude and alienate the south , the libyan - egyptian initiative appears to be gaining wider acceptance . 
kenya has intense possessiveness of the igad process and does not brook interference from other african countries ; nor does ethiopia . 
a number of countries , including canada , think that eventually all affected parties need to be party to the peace agreement , including a role for egypt and the opposition nda coalition . 
nigeria and south africa have also indicated interest . 
it is not yet clear how this will be accomplished , but any peace initiatives need to be rolled into the igad process . 
nor is the role of the oau and its conflict resolution unit clear . 
there is broad acknowledgement that it is not possible to end the brutal war in sudan with a series of separate , that is , piecemeal , initiatives , but the position taken by the government of sudan toward igad as a narrow , geographically defined peace forum forces the international community to do some hard thinking . 
in an attempt to redefine the context , strength and support for a comprehensive peace process , canada will try to raise the profile of the sudan situation and the peace process in international forums such as the security council and at the un human rights commission in april . 
these initiatives may be unacceptable internationally because of the self - interest of particular countries in the sudan . 
however , canada will persist in its efforts . 
does it believe it can sustain the status quo indefinitely through low - level military actions and through deliberate bombing of civilian hospitals and schools ? 
perhaps . 
it speaks of the conflict as the " southern problem . " 
the south speaks of its " war of liberation " against government that came to power through a coup . 
it insists on the separation of the state and religion , and the right of self - determination , even though no government structures are in place for that eventuality . 
conflict over resources such as oil and water will continue . 
arabism versus africanism will create contradictions difficult to overcome . 
what is at stake is the possible dismemberment of the largest country in africa , and regional destabilization . 
what steps has canada taken or could take , given the fact that canada is not brokering the peace but is supporting the african regional authorities who at this point are charged with that task ? 
already , through cida , canada supports the inter - africa group , an igad resource think tank , as well as igad itself . 
it supports peace and reconciliation efforts through waterloo ' s project ploughshares and quebec ' s alternatives that bring together warring tribes in the process of reconciliation . 
support continues for the new sudan council of churches in its facilitation of reconciliation between the warring tribes of the nuers and the dinkas . 
canada supports the dutch embassy ' s sudanese women ' s peace initiative , which brings together africans and arabs , south and north , christian and muslim , which movement is sponsoring an international meeting in april in the netherlands . 
of course , said the dutch embassy , they could never have mounted such a program without being fully present on the ground in the sudan . 
this initiative is the most hopeful sign i saw in the sudan . 
the women are tired of having their husbands killed , their sons fighting a war , and a lifetime of despair and misery . 
their energy , if expressed in programmatic form , could well contribute to tipping the balance of power . 
canada has also made available , through cida , a person skilled in conflict resolution and a political analyst to work full time in the sudan . 
these efforts contribute toward consolidation of southerners , so that eventually a critical mass might emerge that could correct the imbalance of power between the north and the south . 
the need for a small canadian presence in the south has certain advantages . 
it does not mean that canada is tilting in favour of khartoum . 
rather , it will allow canada to monitor and more adequately assess the situation , including the human rights violations of both the government of sudan and the spla , and support the activities of the ngos active on the human rights and abductions fronts . 
it would be able to support ngos formerly active in the south but now temporarily withdrawn in protest against the spla requirement to place all humanitarian aid under their control . 
it could also better provide political reporting . 
canada could support a human rights desk focused on the oil regions , insisting on independent peace and human rights experts , possibly drawn from the international community through the un . 
it should think about eventual compensation for internally displaced persons . 
it could support efforts to engage progressive christians , muslims , and animists in proposing solutions to both warring parties on the role of religion , provided such efforts are not a showcase for either side of the conflict . 
canada could bring its experience in multiculturalism and in multi - faith communities to this situation . 
as well , our experience in federalism , flawed as it may be , can be a contribution . 
the massive , longstanding suffering continues , as word continues to come of the government continuing to deliberately target and bomb civilians in hospitals and schools , and to use roads built for oil extraction to move troops . 
the problems seem intractable , but a conflict of many years ' standing will not come to an end easily or soon . 
as long as it appears that canada can have a constructive role , our country intends to remain fully engaged . 
thank you for your patience . 
hon. senators : 
hear , hear !

2 . 
oh , oh ! 
oh , oh ! 
oh , oh ! 
let us remember , mr. speaker , that these segments of our society form the backbone of our economy . 
hear , hear ! 
hear , hear ! 
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister of transport . 
both have many years experience in the manufacture and distribution of forest products . 
1 . 
another point i should like to discuss is the right of the supplier to choose his customers as he sees fit . 
i am getting sick and tired of ministers who seem to have some hang - up with regard to the collective bargaining process . 
there is just one specific item more that i would like to comment upon and then i will sit down , mr. speaker . 
order , please . 
3 . 
i can refer him to no better authority on the subject than the hon. member for don valley , not just myself . 
it is quite understandable . 
in addition , it could become a serious threat to confederation and national unity . 
in view of this , we deemed it inadvisable to attend the meeting and so informed cojo . 
mr. speaker , the minister suggested that a greater building program might lead to inflationary pressure . 
i disagree with the argument advanced by the minister . 
there is a lot to be said on both sides of that question . 
order . 
mr. speaker , as i indicated to the leader of the opposition , i would hope to make an announcement on this question on november 1 . 
quite right . 
it does not bring anybody closer to rehabilitation to isolate him from the public . 
he left a wife and family . 
on a point of order , mr. chairman , i am sure the hon. member for verdun would not have denigrated my position . 
can the insurance industry in turn act as an airline ? 
i say this to you , mr. speaker : the people of toronto know the government has no answers . 
their evidence on the state of each stock was taken fully into account . 
thank you very much , mr. speaker , and i thank hon. members for allowing me the privilege to continue . 
i urge this intensive study , mr. speaker , for we know so little about the reasons that turn people into criminals . 
the government must assist its own employees who may need another language to advance their careers . 
i do not have any qualms about the type of language i use . 
motion agreed to . 
mr. speaker , no decision has been reached as yet but i should think so . 
the matter of trade relations with our european counterparts should be very seriously considered . 
what we should be concerned with in this country is the situation when these animals are shipped out of canada for this purpose . 
they have already given an indication of the branches they intend to close . 
this minister watched while half the proceeds and profits of the canadian agriculture industry were swept away in a budget speech . 
mr. chairman , absolutely none . 
we are analysing the report now and i hope to have some information for the house in the near future . 
hear , hear ! 
hear , hear ! 
i would therefore move , seconded by the hon. member for dartmouth - halifax east ( mr. forrestall ) : 
when we realize the extent of the ravages caused by organized crime in our country , we must consider deep - rooted solutions . 
but oh how their popularity soared and they coasted through on that . 
( 2 ) a committee is bound by , and not at liberty to depart from , the order of reference . 
there is one other point i should like to make , and i do so as i feel this is a general debate . 
in december there was an announcement that british columbia would be withdrawing from cema . 
they have also given rise to considerable opposition by hon. members in all parties on this side of the house . 
those are not the lines that one should be concerned about at this time . 
i have allowed the hon. member two supplementaries and in fairness i think we should go to some other hon. members . 
i think that is good . 
i think that the time taken in handling routine applications for changes of facilities along a pipeline , for example , has been too long . 
he is the minister who is responsible for science and technology , and he does not know . 
federal government carpenters get $ 6.42 in toronto and $ 5.23 in halifax and moncton . 
for the record i would like to refer to a press release which followed the federal - provincial conference of attorneys general in october , 1975 . 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
i think the railroad term is « demand loading » . 
i will come to the cost of boats these days . 
in most provinces , general noise regulations have been implemented , the main principle of which is as follows : 
agreed . 
after all , energy is used by people throughout the nation , and the government might well consider an approach using the incentive to which i have referred . 
6 . 
i will be glad , when we have time , to sit down with hon. members and work this matter out on a productive and prospective basis . 
will the minister take action to clear up any difficulties because of the absolute need for placing the orders now , and not some months from now ? 
it will spur the construction of new fishing boats and cause new processing facilities to be built . 
there are many things i could say about bill c - 19 . 
i am going to say something a bit later on about that because i think it is essential to the kind of debate we are having this afternoon . 
companies find that the rules are complicated , cumbersome and changing all the time . 
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister in charge of the canadian wheat board . 
i understand that a rate of at least 70 per cent per annum is being contemplated . 
it is our hope to make a decision this week . 
we accept your view . 
they fought an election on that position . 
12 . 
mr. speaker , i say to that : what a cruel hoax , because a hoax it is . 
mr. speaker , we will try to stick to that suggestion . 
1 . ( a ) $ 98,355 . ( b ) they are distributed through major post offices across the country . 
crime is a national problem according to our constitution , while law enforcement is a provincial and local responsibility . 
i submit that what i say is pertinent to the bill , to moneys being spent on medicare and the manner in which they are spent . 
a few words about this disease might help to put things into perspective . 
fortunately they are fewer this year , more reasonable and responsible , more conciliatory . 
this bill has been before the house for more than a year . 
retired december 30 , 1975 following completion of 34 years of public service . 
passage of the hon. member 's motion would mean that the content requirements are spelled out in the statute and we could debate them . 
this does not necessarily indicate non - compliance on the part of the parties . 
i was not asking for a detailed explanation as to what he was doing . 
how can so much be asked , on the one hand , and so little answered on the other ? 
as a result , perhaps he will bring in different legislation which will not lay him open to the charge of censorship . 
either they do their job properly , or you must get the power so that you can be sure that they do it properly . 
in our national capital we have all the strains and all the divergencies of our country . 
hon. john n . turner ( minister of finance ) moved : 
as much as i hate to admit it , there has been good legislation brought in by liberal governments in this country -- 
as the member for the neighbouring riding i am well aware of his persistence and hard work . 
where is the aib ? 
at the moment , that fact , unfortunately , is seen in two - thirds of the country not as an opportunity , but as a barrier to opportunity . 
do not force a moratorium down our throats . 
this not the first time that members of parliament are going to hear that . 
the same recommendation was made in the report of the standing committee on privileges and elections on april 29 of last year . 
mr. speaker , i am afraid the hon. member is ill informed . 
in the mot accident report it is stated : 
mr. speaker , the federal offer was for a $ 100 million program . 
in most samples of this size -- that is , a group of over 500 -- this would be called negligible . 
the traditional procedure for seeking new borrowing powers is to attach a clause to supply bills brought before the house . 
this strikes at the roots of democracy , and it is the right of the people to know . 
this would relieve the pressure on oil . 
the special investigation division has not been in existence since early 1975 . 
moreover , this is not a matter of saying whether we are for or against some sort of assistance for adoptive parents . 
let us see the documents . 
canada has continued to give its support to the nato alliance as an absolutely indispensable deterrent and an absolutely indispensable assurance of our security . 
can you believe such a ban in 1978 ? 
no , mr. chairman . 
naturally , the government attempts to get the best possible deal for the canadian public in any series of negotiations . 
i would add , mr. speaker , that it must be continued . 
if i want any statistics as to where this country stands , certainly i will not refer to the speech made by the prime minister . 
we looked at all the implications of that . 
perhaps it would be a good idea for me to quote a timmins newspaper because maybe it relates to the hon. member . 
mr. speaker , indeed i have the final report from the prairie rail action committee . 
( ii ) ( a ) three vehicles will be used by six canadian experts related to the provision of technical assistance . 
1979 . 
and we will implement every recommendation in the auditor general 's report , something which we have been calling for over the last ten years . 
first , mr. speaker , i should like to make a few general remarks . 
mr. chairman , i will see if there is such a figure available , but i would quarrel with the words of the hon. member . 
i know he would not want to divert me from responding to a very serious question by his colleague . 
continually we get the message from across the way that this program will cost the government something . 
that is the crowd which did not like the 18 cents . 
what is at issue here is the principle that the public of canada has a right to know about the constitution of canada . 
they want to pick and choose what they will support . 
do you have it in writing ? 
i realize , mr. chairman , that there is no magic solution . 
in 1978 americans divorced 1,122,000 times . 
the very result of unemployment breaks up families , and contributes to excessive alcohol and drug use . 
the official opposition was trying to destroy petro - canada in the short six months it was in office . 
instead of causing an internal schism , 
and now they are applauding themselves for voting against security of supply . 
as to making contributions , i am reminded of a story . 
madam speaker , i would like to hear from the hon. member before i move my motion . 
the previous speaker also mentioned they would like to have the provinces involved in preparations for any meetings . 
my friend from toronto says 53 more years . 
all of those estimates indicate that canada will be in much more trouble as a result of the national energy program than we were in before . 
mr. prime minister : 
indeed , there will be more divisiveness than positive effects . 
world - wide inflation is causing a severe form of economic dislocation . 
the pt7 represents the beginning of a new family of engines in a power range above that of the highly successful pt6 engine . 
mr. speaker , i welcome the opportunity to join in this adjournment debate -- 
the competition policy is as vital to an industrial strategy as the over - all plan or the specific set of plans which should be developed . 
we are now talking about $ 45 billion to construct the pipeline . 
these flaws are all reflected in this bill . 
at this stage of the debate of the resolution , there are three specific amendments which my party proposes to introduce . 
the government cannot claim that there is any change in the balance of ways and means . 
a substantial provision of federal assistance for regional development comes under this program , rida , and subsidiary units . 
what did the government do ? 
he said that if we use unemployment as the solution to inflation , we will get recovery . 
conservation is beginning to have its effect . 
there could be a steel mill in british columbia , for example . 
order , please . 
that is why professionals should not be charged for their work in progress . 
i believe , mr. speaker , that what is happening today is a good thing but it is just the beginning . 
however , the people of canada are responsible for making those payments . 
we are now faced with legislation that is designed to withdraw from programs that were introduced at a time when we could afford them . 
that is why we had to import 25,000 skilled workers into this country at a time when unemployment was rising . 
as carter said back in the 1960s , « a buck is a buck is a buck » and should be taxed as such . 
order , please . 
all of this means a total cut over the next two years of $ 2,958 , or 15 per cent of the original $ 20,000 salary . 
we heard in the news this morning that the heath - steele mine in northern new brunswick is being closed down . 
they are ready to follow our leadership . 
we have a number of those kinds of programs and discussions going on at the present moment . 
out of that momentum of ideas and activity , we have to ask ourselves , why has the development problem not been solved ? 
i would like to end on a positive note , mr. speaker . 
i want to make it plain , mr. speaker , that the federal government does not set retail prices . 
the house met at 2 p.m. 
i remind hon. members that the minister in respect of transmission lines referred to the same power that now exist . 
that is truly a laudable goal with which we all agree . 
madam speaker , i have a supplementary question for the minister of transport . 
let me come now to petro - canada . 
this will result in tremendous savings . 
unfortunately , no one seems to know what the effect will be . 
we have allowed a subgovernment across the country to remove power from the house of commons . 
that is quite substantial . 
what exactly is going on over there ? 
madam speaker , i will be very brief . 
that government simply tells the people what is good for them . 
it is the seasonally adjusted figures which show the .5 per cent drop which are the important figures . 
the chair is really embarrassed by what is taking place . 
mr. speaker , i am sorry , i have not seen the statement by a british firm . 
fewer volunteers are available because so many women have returned to the work force . 
they work with them . 
it depends on the extent to which they apply themselves . 
i do not know if there is a member in this house who would oppose allocating more money for the elderly . 
they also have a role to play in the food chain . 
this has given a more democratic element to the things we were faced with in our constituency . 
the problem is to obscure the memories of everyone who heard the minister 's stupid statements of a week ago . 
will the ministry fill in the ravine at the end of runway 24l at the pearson international airport at toronto ? 
if we ever introduce such legislation , i will remind him of his offer . 
my response is , so what ? 
this , sir , is what i recommend to the house . 
whether that will do any good , i do not know . 
that is the principle which must guide the alliance in the future as we seek fair and verifiable agreements with the soviet union . 
i guess the same kind of answer would have to apply to the matter of automobiles . 
they are bringing before the house a bill that will restrict those liberties . 
for debate , the hon. member for bow river ( mr. taylor ) . 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the government refuses to believe it . 
those were very challenging commitments , a sort of preview of what the very important agricultural sector might become . 
there are two revolving - door syndrome and gating . 
i hope he will be back with that mobilized public opinion . 
i think the argument being made by the government is faulty . 
however , we do have enough money to bail out two banks . 
order . 
it can be stolen just as other types of property can be stolen . 
and , second , mr. speaker , what we have been doing since last november is building up a climate of confidence . 
members should know that credit unions are a very big factor in financial institutions in western canada . 
the member for cochrane - superior ( mr. penner ) said earlier tonight that the onus is on the government to free up its members . 
that is my point . 
what of women who live far from centres where these services are available ? 
they ask the members of this house to put an end to all cuts in personnel at these shops . 
it is not a question of joining ; we are well ahead . 
in an article written by dr. kenneth hare , recognized in this country as being one of our foremost atmospheric scientists , the following appears : 
the impact is pervasive . 
in other words , a subsidy of about $ 2 per bushel will come from the reagan administration to the grain farmers of the united states . 
the full report will be coming in before the fall . 
if these rules were put in place , would we indeed be treating everyone in the same way ? 
in them this former distinguished speaker of the house talked about sexual harassment where some women had to disrobe to qualify for their jobs . 
i am simply alerting members to a problem that i see , given what has been happening . 
the conservatives while in opposition , of course , said quite the contrary to what they are doing now . 
in point of fact , both the minister of justice and the solicitor general have responded fully , as best human beings can . 
does the deputy prime minister believe that this is the way for a responsible government , or an independent nation , to make an international treaty ? 
the parliamentary subcommittee is considering the whole question of equality rights . 
the fact is that no applications involving fewer than four student employees is being subjected to any test of whether or not the jobs are career oriented . 
we also want a series of objective criteria based on factors such as those i am referring to . 
if we proceed on that basis in this or in any other direction in public life , we will always be able to find excuses . 
then you brought in your program , the hotel went down the tube and fort st. john became a ghost town . 
well , in six months , we did consult , we sat down with the minister and hammered out an agreement . 
the right hon. member might disagree with her perspective as well . 
" let us try it , " they say , " and see if it works . 
approximately $ 3 million of this amount is allocated from dree funds , with the remainder being committed by the department of indian affairs and northern development . 
it cannot be stressed too often that canadians are disturbed by the increase in violent crime . 
grain exports are projected to fall by 25 per cent in the 1984 - 85 crop year . 
we are so far behind in this field it makes the whole country feel embarassed . 
they do not really change the status . 
there is no longer any distinction to be made on a rational basis between an intermediate range and an intercontinental range nuclear missile . 
could i ask the member for western arctic for a brief answer , if possible . 
greater victoria is a tourist mecca . 
that tax will not be collected and then refunded . 
there has been a commitment in the past that their participation rate would go at least to historic levels if not traditional levels . 
that is to say , at the request of the person who may be going to declare his refugee claim . 
that is the actual situation . 
equalization payments have become quite considerable through the years . 
it has been a matter of concern to representatives of all parties . 
i would also like to advise the house that there was a degree of consultation with respect to the pc caucus members from manitoba . 
the part played by military personnel and their families in the life of the town will be long remembered in a most favourable light . 
with great respect , i must interrupt . 
i explained it then . 
if the prime minister said that he was willing to resume negociations with quebec , why are they in such a hurry to pass this bill ? 
in fact , that is why a number of my colleagues have spoken out quite vigorously on the subject . 
i should like to put on the record just exactly what is in the notes on the financial statement of march 31 , 1984 . 
that judgment is sent to the individual in question . 
that does not make sense . 
mr. speaker , many authorities were involved in acting on this emergency . 
however , what happened to the studies that were conducted after that incident occurred ? 
there was a clear understanding by the former minister of transport that these regulations would not be promulgated for a year . 
i feel that is an attitude in cabinet which we do not have the luxury of allowing to continue . 
in other words , mr. speaker , the government must implement the recommendations of the commissioner of official languages . 
they will then reduce the number of jobs because what they buy will be a duplication of other operations they have . 
it is at the second stage of review that the supreme court has ruled that a hearing is compulsory . 
as for lawyers specialized in immigration matters , the bar takes upon itself to penalize them . 
the alternative in terms of foreign investment is loan capital . 
does he want to wait until the economy of those rural areas is completely down before responding to the acid rain problem ? 
i think that should not be too difficult to understand . 
however , we must not forget that the majority of beef and pork producers have rejected outright any mechanisms for marketing stabilization . 
if i had been in bryce 's position , i would have been right in there with my nose to the public trough with the rest of them . 
in other words , we consider that the political role and the administrative role should be kept separate . 
as a result , the government had to take steps to see that the company was taken over . 
all of these heritage places are managed by parks canada for the benefit and enjoyment of all canadians . 
as i indicated earlier in this ruling , such discrimination was not envisaged in the bill when it was given second reading . 
there is a role for both the public and the private sector . 
there will be more criticism , perhaps , because this government , as i understand it , is committed to making things more open to the public . 
that is not good enough . 
he was the one who told us that the construction of a maintenance centre for via rail in montreal would be indefinitely postponed . 
but then mr. baldwin said : 
we want full public disclosure of company commitments involved in take - overs of canadian business . 
there is also a need to co - ordinate with provincial governments as to what certain areas require . 
they are of the opinion that by just changing the name from fira to investment canada we are going to have an automatic inflow of dollars . 
can the minister tell this house what position the canadian government will take in this regard ? 
it is nine months since the election of this government and we have yet to see a budget . 
we currently allow the canadian amateur athletic associations to be registered , and it is my belief that we should allow the provincial groups as well to be registered . 
a canadian amateur athletic association by definition includes federal associations but does not include their provincial counterparts . 
to this battle canada gave 1,800 gallant sailors and 24 proud ships . 
i find it incredible that the president of the treasury board would be laughing about a matter as serious as this . 
they have also asked for additional funding . 
well , everyone would agree with that . 
it is no wonder that there was no permanent chief executive officer for over 12 months . 
the minister spoke of meetings and i applaud that . 
we had to put that in st. john 's . 
that is an accurate description of what is happening . 
they cannot be treated in isolation . 
he obviously does not like the co - op people in eastern canada . 
the federal government has a responsibility to be a policing agent . 
it wants to increase the percentage of its part - time workers to 45 per cent of its total work force . 
in the last manitoba provincial election , 900 mail - in votes were received and were mostly from urban voters . 
what does basic common sense say ? 
standards are actually stricter in abattoirs built according to quebec regulations . 
technicians make more than the writers and playwrights whose works are being performed . 
they were all leftists . 
it is well done . 
yes , we are a small nation and we are vulnerable because of our size . 
mr. wyman has many years of experience in the financial market sector . 
let 's think about that for just a moment . 
i do not think we should beat around the bush any longer about how to set things right . 
it says that resource impact funding helps indian people to get a piece of the action . 
one of the major objectives of these consultations is to make sure that the recovery benefits all . 
mr. speaker , i think that in his speech , the hon. member from baie - comeau misrepresented reality . 
it is a matter of elementary justice that women 's jobs be fairly evaluated . 
we intend to continue this discussion with the benefit of the views of a wide range of interested parties . 
i think particularly of single parents . 
the minister of regional economic expansion treats all matters related to quebec with a great deal of fairness and honesty . 
as a matter of fact that net farm income reached its lowest level since 1970 and the third lowest level since 1938 , some 45 years ago . 
in the laval - deux - montagnes area , $ 225,000 was spent in 1984 but only $ 30,000 will be spent this year mr. speaker . 
this particular minister made personal election promises that he would not only consult with fishermen but that he would be readily available when problems arise . 
that investment is being neglected , primarily in british columbia . 
the outstanding issue has been the failure to make a funding commitment for the erda agreement . 
he should come clean on this issue this afternoon instead of giving us all this gobbledy - gook . 
he said that british telecom « has not demonstrated its marketing savvy or product management ability » . 
foreign investment was running canada as though it were the fifty - first state . 
it does not conduct research and development . 
the first question is : why does agriculture require stabilization ? 
as a general rule , all the producers of any given commodity are affected simultaneously by a cost - price squeeze . 
we have a diversified riding . 
so the real problem is that farmers are leaving farming . 
let us go to the question of what the public seems to be saying on this issue of senate reform . 
as this is what is required , it is the target the government has in mind . 
that , i believe , we all find unacceptable , regardless of political party . 
let me return to the bill which is before us . 
it is a mistake to do what the tories are proposing to do to differentiate their bill . 
we know how painful that can be for people who are going through a period of their life which is not particularly joyful . 
the establishment of such a system should therefore be a priority in each province where it does not already exist . 
we have been colleagues for a long time . 
it will help canadian companies to accelerate their return to a healthy financial position by attracting new equity investment . 
the universal family allowance is maintained . 
research is a low priority . 
oh ? 
there are increased costs for shampoo and drinks for kids , pet food , gas , and even heating the home . 
this technique is not unusual on the basis of precedents . 
similarly , under the last liberal budget , personal income increased in 1984 by 7 per cent . 
but the government treats itself to lavish spending and engages in bailing out corporations . 
there will be improved survivor benefit regulations for women , standards for pension benefit splitting on marriage breakdown , and equality standards . 
in fact , if one adds in some other things resulting from the western accord , i think it is more likely to be 2.8 cents per litre . 
we follow through with our election pledges . 
we must revive our economy , create jobs , rationalize government spending , administer with increased efficiency . 
it does not make a lot of sense , particularly when you look at who is paying . 
what will they do with that capital ? 
that is roughly equal to the $ 440 million paid to canadair in two years . 
from these hearings , it became obvious that the major concern was capital gains . 
it indicates to individual canadians that for too long government has made their decisions for them . 
that brings to mind the hundreds of young canadians i met recently , most of them quite disillusioned . 
this is why i cannot find myself supportive of the request for additional funding for the government by way of borrowing . 
the hon. member says : « neglected quebec » , and i agree . 
i was glad to hear that crown corporations with a commercial value but no ongoing public policy purpose will be sold . 
we have taken these considerations very much into account when we designed the budget . 
will the prime minister live up to that commitment ? 
can the minister clarify the effect of the reduction ? 
thus far , i have been describing the physical aspects of my constituency . 
we believe they will accept the challenge . 
can he tell them that is fair ? 
it has been years and years since our business community got such a vote of confidence from government . 
the progressive conservative party of canada is providing the opposition . 
they stood to a person and applauded loudly . 
eight . 
no , mr. speaker , not quite . 
i would like now to go into the theory behind the removal of capital gains tax . 
it will increase poverty in the most vulnerable people , senior citizens , who will not be able to go out and find other sources of income . 
cfb moose jaw is also the home of the snowbirds , canada 's aerobatic air team . 
our caucus heard the other day from the atlantic provinces economic council . 
come on , give us a break ! 
that is one major problem . 
i wish to direct the majority of my comments today to the many improvements offered in the pension programs available to all canadians . 
furthermore , the erosion of the cost base of assets by inflation was also regarded as something that should be compensated for . 
the budget is realistic because it takes a balanced and sensible approach . 
that is not the interest or concern of this government . 
they voted for a change in the national affairs of our nation . 
on a point of order , mr. speaker . 
the facts are clear . 
the motion of the hon. member for beaches therefore gives us an opportunity to do in this house what everyone else is now doing throughout the country . 
they also have a technical library , and the company spends nearly $ 2 million annually on these research services . 
second , we want to assist canadian businesses to exploit opportunities for investment and technological advancement . 
not only are the risks greater but the time required to prepare for marine re - supply is lengthy . 
mr. speaker , once again the liberal and ndp forecasters of economic doom and gloom have been proven wrong . 
i am not going to bother boring the house with those answers again . 
however , when we came into office we discovered that the trend line was going up . 
only the document cited need to be tabled by a minister . 
furthermore , there is the provision in our resolution of having had to serve for a period in excess of 365 days in canada as the basis of eligibility . 
the government said that it had not had time to talk to either group about that proposal . 
in other words , the writing is on the wall . 
they were saying that homeowners would lose again because interest rates were rising . 
our international role has somehow collapsed . 
for instance , if we look at crop insurance , the federal government has put up half the premiums and the producers have put up the other half . 
so we cannot think in those terms . 
the minister has said that the only problem with candu and the whole nuclear power option is a marketing one . 
why was it that i was receiving those kind of representations ? 
» that is what the present prime minister told the former prime minister . 
most of them are unable to work . 
a few days ago my colleague from essex - windsor gave the house a history lesson . 
the article reads : 
he said that he was burning oil . 
the government has yet to come to the point of determining how and when this change should take place . 
i referred earlier to the bet taken up by the prime minister ( mr. mulroney ) concerning employment as related to immigration . 
however , we see in the legislation before us today only two substantive amendments and a number of housekeeping amendments to the bill . 
we as a society cannot afford to discriminate among individuals on that sort of basis . 
this type of federal - provincial co - operation is required to increase the sensitivity and efficiency of our current disease surveillance systems . 
he suggested that june at least would be a better time . 
in 1934 , the company was renamed the northern transportation company limited , still under private ownership . 
i do commend the minister of transport for following through on the original terms of reference . 
then and only then does the private sector rush in saying that it cannot have all these publicly - owned corporations interfering in the private sector . 
specialty services such as stand - by supply vessels for the beaufort sea oil and gas industry can be provided by others . 
unfortunately or fortunately , however one views the issue , that particular minister has not met with very much success . 
however , perhaps the chair could dispose of motion no. 1 . 
on the west coast we have the minister 's advisory committee which , while not perfect , is at least of assistance . 
this is a fine example of a partnership in progress between government and industry . 
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister of transport . 
mr. speaker , let me be clear . 
within the government of canada , a number of departments have been actively involved and have been proceeding in a co - operative and coordinated fashion . 
however , the contradiction between what he said and what has been said by his officials requires further independent investigation . 
i know that we are trying to do it , at the federal level through the farm credit corporation . 
these are key economic indicators . 
production is being expanded with the development of a sixth farm at bowden institution in alberta . 
that was the principle of the bill as passed on second reading . 
surely no one , and particularly no member of the conservative party , would believe that . 
the people of canada did that on september 4 . 
call in the members . 
we think that now is the time for the regulations and procedures to be properly established . 
the point was well taken because the success of these agreements will depend to a considerable degree upon the quality of their administration . 
canada can be proud of its record on human rights and should serve as an example of tolerance to other countries . 
whose advice did he follow in making his decision , in that his officials rejected it ? 
mr. speaker , i am pleased that the prime minister has provided the information in the house . 
may i therefore ask the hon. member to refrain from any further displays . 
why did the prime minister appear prepared to disregard his promise in the first place ? 
mr. speaker , i am always amused by these probing questions from the liberal party , the party which says that it would control the deficit . 
surely the hon. member is not suggesting that we levy taxes on companies that have been losing money . 
mr. speaker , the premise of the question put by the hon. member is wrong . 
how many people are employed ( a ) directly or by contract ( b ) full time and part time , in the office of the prime minister ? 
the fees paid to each performer were in keeping with the role played in the gala and with the standards of the union des artistes . 
during the liberal administration nothing was done about it . 
they know about the overproduction problem . 
each of them is very complex , but the link between the two is even more complex which makes the whole situation for most people understandably confusing . 
the commissionners went on : 
they are constrained by limits which are imposed in order to ensure that the freedom of one person does not violate that of another . 
it made the buying and selling of sex on our streets legal for all intents and purposes . 
the way in which bill c - 49 has been presented today gives us the feeling that only the prostitutes are punished and stigmatized . 
i never met a street hooker who wanted to be there . 
the establishment of the standing committee by unanimous consent of the house on june 28 , 1985 has already been noted . 
i have stressed the cdc as an example of creative , aggressive effective public ownership . 
so far , around $ 250,000 have been issued by the institute in grants for research or public education activity . 
let me conclude . 
i think we should take a hard look at this justification to determine whether or not it is cost effective and in the public interest .
